# Transcript of the Meeting: meeting-be50ec9d-c187-4156-b0af-97e76e88ce1c - Meeting to Discuss Proposal Software Development

## Date: 1/8/2026

[00:00] So the
[00:02] The way we think about it right now is either I upload some type of Excel into the software or we find the software that connects to Salesforce and as soon as somebody creates the opportunity in Salesforce it triggers proposal. So I uh you will either have an Excel similar to uh what I sent you. Let me see if I can open that one and share the screen.
[00:33] Okay.
[00:34] So
[00:42] Okay, and here
[00:46] Let's share the screen.
[00:51] Mm.
[00:59] Uh Excel share. Can you see my Excel?
[01:05] I do, yeah.
[01:07] Okay. So either I will upload something like this to the system and when I say something like this it will have column A C and D. So usually a client think about it like this. Client comes to me and says I want to have a level even approximately three by one thousand uh square foot, but thinking it needs to be a 10 millimeter product. And I also want to see a pricing for out of town screen, Mavillian screen and level even screen. So they provide me the names of the screen and obviously I know who the client is so in this case is ABCDE. And then they don't know what product to use because they come to meet as an expert for that. They know like about what size they need but not specification. So I will put this information to the software that you will build or uh you will connect us to Salesforce that strips the disinformation from Salesforce where I typed it in. Then we have like a catalog of products. So if it's an outdoor product 10 millimeter, we won't have like a thousand, we will have like two options, this and that. And you the software will ask me a couple of questions to pick which product to use. I don't quite know what questions but we will sort that a little bit later. And then based on my answers, it will auto-populate all of this. It will tell me what product type it chose between multiple options, what millimeter each, and then it will calculate exact specification. So fee by whatever is kind of like a goal park and this exact specification for that particular product type based on the cabinet size and all of that. Then it's gonna calculate pixel count also based on the calculations that we will uh feed your software and then uh the um
[03:09] The qu qu quantity of screens is something you will also actually the quantity of screens and names of the screens is gonna be something that's like client tells me kind of like given.
[03:22] So based on the quantity of screens and the multiplications of um of um pixel counts
[03:32] Uh you arrive to your price. Uh so pricing is uh we know how much once where I post. Am I still sharing my screen? No you're not.
[03:46] Okay.
[03:48] Uh so we know how much
[03:53] We have the calculations that uh square feet by um the pricing for square feet is uh quantity of screen multiplied by this No total square foot is um square foot per screen multiplied by number of screens and then we know that the cost
[04:12] It would be
[04:14] total square feet divided by display cost.
[04:20] Okay.
[04:23] Uh is this uh the column and the names, are they are they uh always like this? The names like for example column A or B or D are are they always going to be the same or do they differ?
[04:40] Can you say it again?
[04:42] So so just I'm trying to understand. So for example you get on a on a call with a client and they explain to you what they need. Uh it i i is it you you you you you you you you you you you have this access sheet and you fill it, you you you see the the the the the the the the the the the the client needs this and that you fill this access sheet right
[05:02] So for now we'll do all this manually. So this is my template that Astimation team is using. We talked to the client, we typed in this, then we looked somewhere in our catalog, which is Excel or PDF. We typed in beat specification, we typed in this, we typed in that. We know from our data piece that for this specific screen for this specific type of display cost per square foot is a dollar, let's say. Then it's multiplications that the software that Excel is doing. It multiplies total square feet by one dollar. It provides me display cost and things like this. Um but it always gonna be in this order, this columns and things like this, yes. Okay, great, great. Now I I I I I I I I I I I I I have a better understanding. Um this is all of the different things that go into that. There's a display cost, there's shipping, then there's a total cost, which is a summary, uh not summary, is a sum of display cost and shipping, then we have some type of margin, and total price is uh um your total cost multiplied by the margin. So then all of this is kind of like calculated automatically. So
[06:25] Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah. Go ahead.
[06:29] No, it's just so this is how this Excel works. So it's a lot of manual typing and we have to look at our catalog to fill out all this information. So the hope is that if we feed in the software the catalogs and it auto-populates all of this for us, and then the catalog will have a price for square foot. Once we put price per square foot, you have a formula that you multiply price per square foot on the total square foot, you know how much is the screen, shipping is also something else, like there's a formula for shipping, and then total cost is shipping plus your cost for display, and then you apply margin on those two numbers, and this is how much we're gonna present the store cost to the client. So this is how this Excel is uh populated. Once this uh Excel is populated, there's many many other tabs. We have to calculate project management and content creation and ship uh and uh engineering and this and that for every single screen. Okay. I did not include those tabs here, but what you we we we we we we we we we we will have them. Okay, now it makes sense. Okay, I get it. Okay, right, so this is how this Excel is calculated. So it's a part one is to get generate this Excel. Then we completed this task. We use some type of formulas, we feed in some type of um what's that called? Some type of uh PDFs into the software and it spits out this Excel. And if we need to modify how this Excel looks slightly, that's fine, nobody cares. Like you can use different fonts, you can use different things, it's whatever. This is a working document. As long as the information is here and the software can generate something similar that has similar information, not looks, nobody cares. So we have this now. This sheet comes to the proposal team. Proposal team are people who make this information look pretty and ready to be sent to the client. So
[08:39] Uh
[08:43] Let me see. So this this this this is this
[08:52] And I want to share, stop sharing, and then share windows this one.
[09:00] Sure. So now that information that Excel is sends to me. Sends to me. And I'm manually typing all of this. I'm looking at the Excel and I'm typing the client's name. Sales quotation space because this is just like a name of the thing. Um Then I put the name of the client here and I Google its address.
[09:24] And it's a purchaser and I and C sports is us and our address is always the same. Now every single screen from the Excel is now on this PDF. So this is this was called on my Excel some type of level ribbon, remember? Yeah. Now it's like for this particular thing it is called it ribbon. And all those specs that you saw there 10 millimeter one screen, this is the height, this is the width, this is resolution. That information from that Excel is manually typed here, which is super annoying. For every single screen. So on that file that I send you, we had four screens. Sometimes I will have 40 screens. So I have to type information about 40 screens. So all of this is moved to this PDF in this format. Again, we can do some tweaks to this format, but I want to keep the font, the colors the same. Because this is our branding, this has been approved by our branding thing. So how this PDF looks, I'm a little bit more particular. And then for every single screen, we have a tab like this that tells how much it actually gonna cost to implement because it's a price for the screen and to ship the screen, but also you need to install put structural blah blah blah blah. All of those line items are line outline here. And this number pricing is uh the final total cost from that XL.
[11:06] Okay.
[11:08] I'm sorry, uh the pricing is what exactly again if we can repeat? Yeah. So
[11:39] So now I'm kind of hoping I'm sharing the full screen. How do I make this thing a little bit?
[11:46] Yeah, I can see I can see them.
[11:49] Okay. So do you see here it says reverse level even
[11:55] On my XL do you see that? Uh I I I don't really see like what's in there. I see the structure because the font is not very clear now.
[12:09] So this this this this this this this this this this this the name here reverse level even will repeat on my PDF as a header for specification and then as a header for the pricing and then this now reverse level even this line item
[12:27] is exactly the same as this thing.
[12:31] It's this one. Okay. And then this price, which is here, says one dollar, is a combination of
[12:40] That's a bad one for that.
[12:42] Of all the calculations we did here.
[12:46] And then we we we we we we we we we we we came to have a total price
[12:51] So this number total price is what I'm looking at and typing here as a pricing.
[12:58] And then I will have additional tabs that calculate in the same manner structural materials. And uh um
[13:08] Whatever, labor, electrical data, all of that and then at the end the number that's called total price. This is the number that goes here. And that's how we come up with the pricing for every single screen. Great. So but you don't really care yeah, uh what I'm trying to get is that you don't care about the other tabs if you had the solution that uh solves it for you. So if the software that we're building is you basically feed it the let's say you know, just for the sake of uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh wording here, we give it the catalogue, the product, and we give it uh a really good system prompt and so on. And then what you do basically is with how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how you imagine it would happen, you give it let's say the meeting notes or the client brief. It will then automatically think, generate, do the math for everything.
[14:06] And basically gives you let's not not let's not talk PDF, let's just talk text.
[14:12] It just gives you the text that is the table uh with with with with with with with with with with with the subtotal the pricing and everything. You wouldn't need the other tabs, correct? Am I following?
[14:25] I would need other so this tab helps you calculate cost for for the screen. How would you know how to calculate cost for structural materials? So imagine that um Well structural materials is uh is is new for every screen because it depends on the on the size of the screen on all different things, if it's an outdoor or indoor. So every single time we gonna have a screen we will have to have some type of prompts that ask you is it an indoor or an outdoor screen? Is it front um service or back service? Is this this this this this this this this this this this or that and that way it's gonna be indoor or outdoor do we have a specific pricing for example for the indoor uh or does that change?
[15:18] Yeah, change every time. There's like maybe twenty different options. There can be different millimeter speech, they can be outdoor indoor. It can be um like um like a wavy screen or it can be a straight screen, it can be different different things. So you will have to have many prompts that ask us questions like is it an outdoor screen or indoor? Is it gonna be curvy or is it gonna be straight? Is it gonna be mounted like this or mounted like that? Is it gonna have uh do you need a ladder or you need uh blah blah blah? And that's how you're gonna arrive to structural material of cost. And then depending on all those questions, you will have a list of questions to answer. And you will come up with a structural labor and installation cost. And then you will say is there an outlets there, is there electrical, or we need to pull cables, and that's how you're gonna calculate electrical data. And then you will ask us questions about how many people need to be on site, how long is gonna be installation, and you will calculate project management. And then you will ask questions about um
[16:29] Do we have drawings so we provide drawings? Do we pay for permit or client pays for permit? And that's how you're gonna calculate this line item. And then you will ask us questions about control system and that's how you're gonna calculate this. So LED display is one piece of a puzzle, but every single line item here has the same tab like this one and even more complicated to calculate all of these guys.
[16:58] Okay. Uh Natalia just to understand like uh well like what if or maybe I'm just like I'm just trying to to to to to to to to to to to to get uh the the full picture so what wouldn't you would wouldn't it be easier if you for example had the phone call recorded or basically everything that the client needed is is is is is is is is is is is is set in one file in in a text and then you give it to the AI then the AI spits out the whole thing like why wh wh wh wh wh wh wh wh wh why uh I I I'm just trying to get like the question part like wouldn't it be easier if it was pre-answered already
[17:38] Well it's not clients job to know how to install LED. Client doesn't come to us saying I want it to be friend service. Client come to us saying I have a million dollar I want a cool screen. And then it's our job to say, okay, we think for this piece, this is gonna be the screen we're gonna provide. And this is how much it's gonna cost to install it. We have a calculations in Excel that show that. And then we will say okay, this is gonna be how much this and that is gonna cost. So uh
[18:21] Uh so we uh yeah I I don't know like there's no way to to have that type of calculation done in a text format. Like you need to apply some formulas to structural materials, you need to have like uh we have some type of formulas that we use. We say that if this is that structural material will be twenty percent of LED cost and then labor will be fifteen percent of this and that. So we have like formulas that we use to ballpark how much things are gonna cost. And we will provide you with all of that data of course. So you will you will have the formula, but you will need to set up the software in a way that it prompts us with those questions and then puts them somewhere on the separate tab every time. Okay, uh to be honest with you, I in order for me to like get everything and so on, I definitely need the data, all of it, uh everything you can give me. So I can sit with myself and just really like study and and you know kind of like try to you know tailor or customize the best approach or the best solution because this is a little you know uh it it it's not um you know it's not like uh one plus one equals two kind of thing, you know what I mean? So uh we need to we need to really it is not and I'm not expecting this project to be done in like 15 hours. This is not that type of project. It's gonna take you a couple of weeks to build. So my uh the the purpose of this call is to get like a ballpark, what do you think how much you charge per hour and how long do you think it's gonna take you from understanding all the uh you need to understand all of things we need to do. You need to meet with different people, estimators will explain you how they calculate structural materials. I will explain you what I'm looking for the PDF to look like. Then you will build some type of prompts for us. We will try it out, we will say what's not working, you will come back and revisit that. Then we will play with this some more. We will come back to you, you will revise this, all of this, like if you give me like a ballpark of like it's gonna be a month of work, it's gonna be like three weeks of work, two weeks, one week, six months, I don't know. Just this is what I'm looking for to get from this ball. Sure. Uh okay, let me be honest with you. Again, I can I can give you an estimate like right now from my little understanding, but this is uh not yet. Okay, let me just talk to you here. Basically what I'm going to give you is a platform. It's called a uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh a rag. It's uh going to pull data and uh do the math and eventually eventually you get uh uh a PDF based on your branding. Um the the trick here is the data and the calculation. I first need to make sure that I'm going to be able to get a valid uh victory as they say. So um in order to do if you need a number like I can give you just quickly I'm expecting anything from like two thousand to four thousand dollars that will take between two to three weeks. But this is just me talking like you know uh ballpark. I would really need to to get the data all of it. I can study it today. I can uh then I can send you a uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh proposal with everything that will be done exactly and how we will do it. And the way I see it is that we do it on uh in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in two parts. The first part is where you do this manually. When I say manually, I I mean uh not automated in terms of salesforce, like salesforce will be the second step.
[22:20] Uh because we first need to make sure
[22:23] the you know the logic is is is is is is is is is is is is is okay. Once once that is set and it's stable then if you want you can we can you know talk about connecting it to Salesforce.
[22:37] But what I mean right now is I I'm thinking you speak to a uh
[22:45] questions you answer those questions eventually it gives you a um you know the text for the video you click a button that button
[22:54] uh g g g g g g g g g gives you the PDF that you need. Uh are we okay so far?
[23:01] Uh uh will it give me an Excel with uh all of these calculations or no? I I can give you an Excel yeah. We can do two parts. We can do
[23:10] C S V and uh PDF.
[23:13] Yeah, we we kind of like um give me a second I'm I'll try to see if I can open some UPDF and then uh for me to send it to you I will need you to sign like an NDA but I will let me see if I can show you like uh an example of uh proposal that has um different tasks. Yeah please
[23:39] And then we w w won't be able to I won't be able to send it to you un un un un un un un un un un unless we this is a bad example. Yeah, I'm I I'm ready if you want me to sign any kind of uh anyway.
[24:19] Alright, so let's see.
[24:25] Do you see my XL?
[24:30] I no no no no no no no no no no no I do yet.
[24:34] Okay, so so these are the the the the the the the the the the the screens that we're pricing
[24:39] And then this is our vendor, this is our product, this is our millimeter feach and sizes and so on. This is how many things, and this is how much square foot cost, and this is the display cost. So you kind of saw all of this already on a previous step, on a previous example, right?
[24:58] You only send me one tab one extra that has one tab, you know, just as an example. So so so so so so so so so so so this tab is this this tab is what you saw before correct?
[25:08] And like I said, uh it's not very clear for me here what I'm seeing. I see the structure but not the exact thing.
[25:16] Yeah, well I I'm not sure how to fix that because it's already pretty big.
[25:23] Uh so this is this is the same thing that I send you in my example the same tab that talks about LED screens and then um
[25:34] the uh all the different details that's pixel pitch uh pixel count square foot number of screens all of that you saw this in a in example that I shared that was the redo file now on top of all of this how do I look this way there is a tab that's called installation and this is the tab that talks about every single screen which is right here
[26:00] uh so this name digital dios or dios whatever it pulls the name from another tab and then these are height and width and these are different formulas that calculate the structural section
[26:20] Structural labor section is calculated here.
[26:24] So this tab had been scene talks about how we calculate for every single screen the labor and uh um
[26:37] Label things like this.
[26:42] And this this here is calculated install. And then there's a tab install h57.
[26:50] Five seven
[26:56] So this is the number. So there's in this particular uh I guess there's no s no I kind of like
[27:05] I didn't I wasn't completely correct. There's no uh tab that is uh calculating every there's no tab for every single line item all of these three line items structural labor and installation are living in one tab that's called install
[27:24] Um so
[27:27] There's some type of formulas that estimators came up with that help them calculate how much all of this is gonna cost. So
[27:36] The prompt that you're gonna be building will be asking those questions and then filling out this sheet for every single screen.
[27:46] Every single screen. This exact sheet you mean? You want this uh template exactly?
[27:56] W when you say that what do you mean?
[28:00] Um okay so so so basically the the the system will generate the the the proposal
[28:07] Or and it will do the calculation. Let's say first step is tech. Then let's say you click a button or uh something and then it becomes uh a PDF. And then it becomes a C S V. Do you want it to go ahead and copy this exact template and then replace whatever is in there with the new content. No Excel and PDF won't be Excel and PDF won't be the same exact documents. Excel has all the backup calculations and PDF only has a client facing information. So I will need to have an Excel that I can open to see what software did to arrive to a structural material number. I will need an Excel that shows me uh the margin that I used. So Excel will be pretty much an answer to every single question and all the calculations that like software ask me a a a lot of questions, I answer them, and then it speeds out an Excel. And then uh
[29:12] Uh
[29:15] There's another kind of like step where you deduct that information. You take out the margin, you don't show all the calculation for structural material. You just provide one number to the client saying structural material will be a million dollars, but somewhere there is a backup Excel that shows how you arrive to a million dollars because it's a um you're adding the number that you paying people, you're adding number that you buy the steel for this and that. So those are two different kinds of things. Client only sees what I want the client to know, and then there's a backup Excel that's um is generated based on the text from the software.
[29:56] Does it make sense? I it does absolutely. I actually uh if if if if if if if if if if if you have a minute, like if you just give me a minute, I can open something for you and just to make sure we are on the same page with that be alright, but I need like an Yeah, I'm a little bit I have like um I need to jump on the next roll, but uh if you can provide me some type of summary of like how you you want to do that and some type of uh uh uh pricing what it's gonna cost. And uh I'd rather you be uh uh generous with your hours because if you say you're gonna build it in two weeks and I put it for two weeks and you cannot complete it in two weeks, we're both gonna be in trouble. Like I would rather you put some cushion there. Um rather you finish a little bit earlier and then just put a fixed price for whatever it's gonna cost. And then oh I'm I'm 100% sure there will be changes. First of all, we will want to have some type of integration with Salesforce, and then we will think about something else. We'll wanna out-timate this, we'll w w wanna like once you start getting into this piece, you always want to improve something. So put some type of number for like a monthly maintenance. If we hire you like an hourly rate will be this much to kind of like reach out to you and to to do different updates, different like whatever. Um I'm saying that because we we we we we we we we we we we went through the uh we used to have proposals just like a PDF files, but then we decided to invest into a digital uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh software that does our proposals. And once we start doing that, we'll be like, okay, this is great, but then a month later we're like okay, let's come up with something else. Okay, let's add this, let's add that. Great. So it's always gonna be like whatever update. So I would like to see like approximate estimate of how many weeks is gonna take you and put some pushing there because I don't want it to be like oh he said two weeks, it's you know it's already going on the third week, what's going on, things like this. And then uh pricing, how much it's gonna cost, and then um I want you to like have in mind that you will need to spend a couple hours with estimators to like understand how they build all of this. So in your proposal um account for at least like two three hours with estimators going through the process, going through what needs to be there, uh like math calculations, things like this, and then put at least an hour with proposal team to talk about granting where the logo goes, what kind of fonts we wanna see, all of the details that goes into a client facing proposal. So at least like four hours to just purely get to know like the team to understand formulas and the rest for how many time you need to to actually build it. Okay, and that's I I I I I I I I I I I have uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh a a proposal for you right now, no strings attached whatsoever. I will what I would like to do actually is to get everything you can give me, whatever is in is in your hands or you can give me I would love to have it. I would love to spend some time on my expense, no worries. Uh and then I what I would like to do is I would like to show you uh uh a demo, let's say an approximate demo. Just because I don't want to you know like I want to show it because the engine is there. I told you I'm I I I I I I I I I I I already built it, but uh then this whole setup that that needs to be uh done. So if you can give you a few. Okay, let me work today on uh on getting this approved. I need to get some blessings to send you this. I will send you NDE. I will send you the file that I can show you and then um uh let me know like if we we we we we we we we we we we can when you you you you you you you you you you you will have a demo to to talk about it, okay? Absolutely, absolutely. Very nice. Thank you so much for your time. Let me jump to the next call, but I I I I I I I I I I I will send you things as soon as I can. Bye. Bye bye.

## Date: 1/14/2026

[00:23] Hi Nati.
[00:26] I'm good, how are you?
[00:38] Great.
[01:20] Sure.
[01:43] Yeah.
[01:55] Yeah.
[02:13] Uh no, it's 2500 uh for this what you've seen and then you have the keep the lights on
[03:33] Uh yes, uh yes, sure. But I have a few questions please. So um
[03:39] Uh okay, when you say scope of work like the SOW basically uh do you want it to do you want it to generate it to be bespoke as in like you just say hey I just spoke to this client and uh the needs are this go ahead show me uh go ahead and you you you you you you you you you you you design it, you you you you you you you you you you you you you come up with the product, you come up with this, or is this uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh predefined
[06:46] Uh that's my question actually I wanted to ask you. So when you when you say you work with other
[06:52] companies or that's uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh entities.
[06:55] Those th th th th th th th th th those guys do you want them to also have some sort of access to the software to where um
[07:03] For example, you you you you you you you you you you you you draft the first proposal like we like you just saw and then basically uh we have some kind of stages like okay and this stage it's with you and the next stage is with the you send it but not uh th th th th th th th th th through email but through the system itself where it goes to the let's call it it's me I am the I am the company
[07:29] You send it to me uh where I have to put in how much I will charge you or um like I'm just trying to figure these things out but do you want them
[07:43] Absolutely, yeah. Uh I I I I it's even better.
[07:59] Yeah, okay.
[08:14] I got.
[08:47] Absolutely. Yeah, that's that's B spoke. So
[08:52] Excuse me.
[09:20] Okay, but
[09:33] Okay, so Natalie just to be uh sure, so I sent you two offerers.
[09:41] Ah, sorry, I'm sorry, so yeah.
[09:46] Okay. Yeah, so Natalia um basically I I I have sent you two things two offers and ironically one of them the the more more expensive one which is the 4000 that's the one which is ready already like because I've already built it
[10:04] It's uh an own project that can be customized and modified. Now from my understanding uh this is what you basically would need uh because it's a rag. A rag is uh is a retrieval uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh it it it it it it it it it it's retrieved so you give it you give it a bunch of documents and it doesn't matter how big or how small and then you say hey uh you ask s you know specific questions get me the uh bunch of whatever it might be and it will do it based on a system prompt which basically means it can generate the proposal and the uh the the scope of work
[10:45] All in all at one time.
[10:47] Plus what you can do you will have like basically work spaces so let's say each client will have its own work space which means uh you don't you don't mix everything uh together. Plus you can have uh like if you have users like you and let's say ten other other other other other other other other other other other users or even if it's not uh user uh maybe uh an outsider of the company you can give it certain permissions like uh he is permitted to you know do this or that, you know? Um
[11:23] Yeah, so these things uh what what what I want to uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh be sure of is is um
[11:32] What I can do if what I can actually uh uh one more thing sorry are you interested in what I just sent you this demo as in the what you saw in this demo as in the the the the whole look and feel or would you be okay using the other system if I modify it and customize it enough so it can generate the same thing however it will have the extra the extra services we just talked about but it will not look the same like it will not give you the preview beforehand it will simply be a normal chat like a chat GPT and then you speak to it and so on and so forth but it has all the logic and all the information that we train it on. That's my question
[13:12] Great. Perfect.
[13:20] That's great.
[13:21] Yeah.
[13:51] Absolutely, that's the right way to do it, uh for the scope of work also. So what we do is we pre-train it, you give me everything, like with every document and all proposals and things that you have, we let the system know the the important things
[14:10] and then it can retrieve it immediately or on the spot. Like l l l l l l l l l literally like maybe sometimes it's even you say hey I need you to come up with a proposal for an XYZ company they want an LED and and here here here here here here here here here here here are the here's the what you call it the specs. You do that and it just immediately spits out the the the the the PDF
[15:34] Um.
[15:42] I I do. I I I yes I understand.
[15:45] Uh N N N N N N N N N N Natalia, do you have um do you have like five minutes now or are you in a hurry?
[15:51] Yeah because
[15:53] Okay great. I would like to show you just a quick example so we are on the same page quickly. If you can see my screen
[16:12] Can can you see my screen?
[16:39] So basically let's say um
[16:44] Just uh quickly because I wasn't ready, so if you don't mind I want to
[16:49] Just quickly show you something.
[17:21] Basically what happens is I designed like uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh something for another client but it's for scope of work. So what you can do here is you create the the workspace. Now this workspace can be either you can decide what you how you want to use it you want to use it for one client or you want like each workspace is for a client or you want one workspace that has threads and each thread is for for for for for for for for for for for one client right now I will give you the example of um
[17:57] of having one one one one one one one one one one one work space that generates all the
[18:03] Uh
[18:04] The scope of it.
[18:43] L like maybe it's my connection.
[18:53] Um
[18:55] Uh.
[18:56] Where
[18:57] It's b basically when you tell it when you
[19:02] would it generate something like um
[19:22] You see all of this I was testing yesterday. Uh all of these are are for you basically.
[19:30] A scope of work is basically when you like the one I wanted to show you is when you already have let's say uh a a prompt you tell it hey I want you to you already give it everything beforehand and then you say we have a client his a A A A A A A A A A A B C and his uh his needs are one two three go ahead work your work your magic then it basically does hey I think they they would need this kind of screen and we should put it in this kind of place and uh the you know what I mean? And then at the end of
[20:40] Th that's absolutely doable yes. But it's right now it's
[20:49] because I'm sharing my screen and stuff is not working. It's basically if you it's like a notion. Have you used Notion before?
[20:59] Uh it's a very it's uh it's a document editor uh plus chat. I I I will send you a video, how about this? Uh af after this call I will send you a quick video that explains it.
[21:12] Okay.
[22:20] Uh yes, yes Natalia. So so basically we're talking about the other project which I have mentioned. It is the one that you would need. You would need uh it it it's it's an AI that also incl includes a document editor. Like um like like like like like like like like like like like basically think of it like a a a a a a a a a a a Google Doc and you can manipulate everything in there. What we can do we can have it set up in a way where it's pre-defined as then we give it the template, we design the template of of the PDF and it gener it it it it it it it it it it generates it automatic it makes things pretty for you
[23:02] That's like yeah, that's one of the things.
[23:05] Um
[23:06] Uh but I wanted to agree with you on Natalia so I know what which which which which which which which which which which which which which which which which which which which which which way to go before we start so it doesn't confuse us later
[23:16] Is um
[23:18] Since you don't really care about the preview so much I highly recommend the other one which I wanted to show you um the other one is basically already built with all these features that we discussed and it's fully extendable and customizable so it can be totally yours and we can really basically do anything that we want with it. Uh this one I can like give it to you for four thousand dollars it's already like it's already a project and we can do it in a way where we can do like 50% you know now or later and then you have the five hundred I was saying uh talking about is
[24:03] hosting and uh uh uh you know like if you need anything that that that might need changes here and there a few tweaks you know that's on me however like any new feature like if if if if if if if if if if if it's considered a feature then that is not included if you if if if if if if if if if if if you know what I mean
[25:54] How about this Natalia? I have a better solution for you. I think this might be the
[26:00] How about we do eight hundred dollars a month and I give you four hours uh
[26:06] I give you three hours a day regardless. It's a new feature, it's a new tweak, it's a whatever it might be. Uh you know, we we we we we we we we we we we do it like that would that be okay with you?
[26:22] A day.
[26:29] Okay.
[26:31] Oh.
[27:37] Okay, good.
[27:57] Yeah.
[28:14] Absolutely.
[28:29] Are you there?
[29:19] Okay.
[29:20] Uh twenty seven. Okay.
[29:26] Yes, absolutely, that's done. But uh okay, so just to agree on the f a few first phases Natalia quickly, you are okay with this kind of uh with this kind of let's call it uh interface, okay? Uh where where where where where where where where where where where I told you you can have many uh users, permissions, uh but you know a lot of pages I will mention is very difficult to go through right now. But the most important is let's say let's say you give it something like this. I I will this was an agency, okay? Hubspot integration and tool ending pages. Okay
[30:04] So you give it something like this. It will immediately start thinking, for example, like that's what I mean.
[30:12] It just stinks and then
[30:15] It does its thing.
[30:17] And then I will show you what happens. It becomes a document.
[30:21] uh in the way in the way that we we we we we we we we we we we set it. So this uh I just want you to I just want to know that we are on the same page in terms of uh
[30:45] Yeah y y y y y y y y y yes if you want that like the uh basically the way I set the demo for you Natalia maybe you didn't notice I set it in a way where it works in both ways. You it asks you the questions one by one or you could have easily uh uploaded a document or gave it the entire uh
[31:09] the entire answers to these questions and then it will no uh uh uh it will know automatically. So let's say there are twenty questions, but you give it hey I want this and this we have this and that. It the what you gave it answers ten questions. It will ask you the ten remaining questions. You you you you you you know what I mean?
[31:33] Yeah, it it it it it it it it it it it it it does work uh in that way it actually it that's why uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh it took me a little bit of time to to to get it done so it does something like this basically a scope over and then what I can do or we do is this
[31:48] Then it becomes um a document that you can really edit it the the the way you want.
[31:55] Um
[31:57] So basically th because this is an agency they have red card you you you work differently so um
[32:06] Or actually maybe this could be actually useful if if if if if if if if if if if if you think it will be I don't know uh you do this it does the calculation automatically like this like for example you do this and it does this thing
[32:20] And also it has the hide where you can hide the
[32:25] Yeah.
[32:27] Yeah total. So be f before you print it.
[32:30] and so on and so forth. Also it has an integrated API where you say for example something like this um
[32:38] Like make it simple, that it can summarise, expand, or you know whatever it might be make it a table, you know? Uh but a l a a a a a a a a a a lot of things where you can also do something like this and say
[32:52] That's the AI.
[32:54] And you can tell it anything. Like you can say extend this proposal
[32:59] In a way um
[33:02] Expand this proposal.
[33:04] You know?
[34:02] Okay.
[34:03] Uh uh I uh I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I did not actually hear the last thing, your voice was cut off. If you can please just repeat it.
[36:11] Uh so I'm just checking if you're still with me.
[36:51] Yeah.
[37:33] Can you?
[38:12] No, it's okay. Take your time, absolutely.
[38:38] N
[39:05] If you don't mind me asking while you look for it, uh Natalia. W when you say r of P so uh it it's like uh
[39:12] w one of those platforms where uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[39:15] uh a a stadium or a company or whatever it might be, they send a a a request for a proposal and you have to apply for it. Uh
[39:55] Right.
[41:27] Uh
[41:33] I don't see I don't
[41:36] Okay now I see it, sorry.
[41:50] Natalia I think something is wrong with
[41:55] I'm so sorry, but I can't hear you. Uh you're breaking. Yeah, your voice is breaking up.
[42:01] Started breaking up right now.
[42:05] And now you're okay.
[42:08] Now you
[42:11] Now you are fine.
[42:25] I can't hear you, I'm sorry.
[43:48] Do you mind Natalia?
[43:52] Would it would would it be okay if you if if if if if if if if if if if you can record uh a short video just to you know explain things it would actually be better for for me as well so I can like you know uh manage everything together and uh send you everything uh that you need.
[44:18] I hear you, yeah.
[45:04] Absolutely. Yeah.
[45:06] Okay.
[45:39] No, no, that's uh that's uh included because if we go to this w
[45:45] what I just mentioned to you what we can do easily is you simply feed it the document
[46:00] So once you give it the
[46:02] the the document with a with one prompt just say hey get me
[46:08] Give me the screens for example.
[46:11] What happens it it it it it it it it it it it it it does its thing and it gives you the table of what you need and
[46:17] And then what you we can have two ways. We can
[46:21] with the manual way where you send it manually and so on or you can create a user for the installer or the estimator or who who who who who who who who who who whoever it might want to go for
[46:34] And you tell it hey, here you go, here's your login details and you can continue work from here.
[47:14] Understood, yeah, and and for this is included. This is already included in the in the four thousand uh pack.
[47:43] Uh I I'm sure uh working together Natalia we we we will uh you know come together with a few things
[47:50] that might be you know could be could be even small things that will really change the way uh the workflow uh is being done. So I'm very excited about this.
[48:57] Okay.
[49:13] Yeah the hosting is not f like if you even if you don't decide to pay me five hundred that's okay but then you would have to host it yourself uh you know somewhere and that is you you you you you you you you you you you will pay for that
[49:26] It's I think it's about a hundred something.
[49:37] Yeah.
[49:41] I
[50:01] Yes.
[50:25] I can get that for you. I can get that.
[50:28] Not now, but I wouldn't.
[50:47] That's great. I will get that done.
[50:56] No no absolutely
[50:58] Yeah, take your time.
[51:10] Awesome.
[51:16] Perfect. So in the meantime what I would would would would would would would would would would would wanna work uh on today is to get you everything we discussed and written uh clear written uh
[51:26] what you will get exactly and and the terms and everything. But also I would love to also work on the you mentioned that you didn't like the PDF. So if you can send me like any c uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[51:40] Okay, we need to sign first so you can send me, right?
[52:34] Okay.
[52:54] Beautiful. Okay, so next step just to conclude
[52:58] I will send you everything that we discuss in and
[53:05] And then you will send me the
[53:07] N D A so we can actually do this proper you know properly. Uh you send me all the things I need to build this.
[53:22] Towards through the platform itself.
[53:27] Uh I can send you the proposal on
[53:31] And then you
[53:33] Except you paid them and they pay me.
[53:39] Yeah.
[53:59] Awesome.
[54:01] Beautiful Natalia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[54:09] I have a

Automate Proposal Response Process Development
Wednesday, Jan 07
Ahmad Basheer

Hi there,



I read your post regarding the high volume of LED display requests you are managing. It sounds like you are looking to build a robust CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) engine rather than just a simple chatbot.



The challenge here isn't just generating text; it's reliably merging strict pricing logic (which must be mathematically perfect) with persuasive, AI-generated content into a polished, branded document. I specialize in architecting these exact types of automation pipelines where internal data needs to be transformed into client-facing assets instantly.



Before proposing a specific technical roadmap, I have three quick questions to ensure I scope this correctly:



Data Access: Is your "internal database" currently accessible via an API or SQL connection, or will the automation need to parse raw exports (CSV/Excel)?



The Output: When you mention "branded budget proposals," are these complex PDF layouts with images and tables, or standard document templates?



The Logic: Is the pricing calculation strictly formula-based (e.g., sq ft * pixel pitch + labor), or does it require human "approval" steps before the final document is generated?



I am available to discuss your workflow and how we can reduce the manual friction in your response process.



Best regards,

Ahmad, really like your CL and questions. Whats the best way to clarify, chat here or short call?

Ahmad Basheer
8:16 PM
Hi Natalia,



A short call is definitely the best move to finalize this.



To ensure I don't waste your time on the call with basic discovery questions, I’d love to review your current workflow beforehand. If you are comfortable sharing any of the following now, it would allow me to come to the meeting with a technical roadmap already sketched out:



The Trigger: A screenshot or paste of 2-3 typical request emails you receive.



The Logic: Your current pricing sheet or Excel formula (anonymized is fine).



The Goal: One example of a finished 'perfect' PDF proposal you want to replicate.



Note: If any of this is sensitive or you prefer to walk through it live, just let me know—no pressure at all. Even just knowing which of these exist helps me prepare!



Let me know what you think, and we can lock in a time

9:38 PM
Hi Ahmad,

A trigger would/can be a different thing, like me manually addind dsiplays, Salesforce entry (if possible to integrate), excel, pdf with names, client bid from ect.

excel an PDf i am more comfortable sharing via call so we dont need to go througt NDA

Ahmad Basheer
10:57 PM
Hi Natalia,



I didn't want to just reply with text, so I recorded a quick video to show you the logic in action.



To be transparent: I have been building a proprietary "Proposal Engine" designed to automate complex quotes for high-volume integrators. When I reviewed your requirements, I realized my engine is already 90% of what you need—it just required your specific fuel.



I couldn't sleep, so I loaded ANC’s deep-technical specs (the LG GPPA062 outdoor units, the LiveSync operating system, and the specific UEFA safety certifications) into the system to test the architecture.



Watch the demo here (2 min): https://www.loom.com/share/bdceb8bc8e604af799807e63a93d034a



Want to drive it yourself? I created a private sandbox environment for you. You can log in and try asking it for different venue setups (e.g., "I need a scoreboard for a college stadium" vs "I need a ribbon board for an arena").

Important Note: The PDF export currently uses my raw "Developer Template." It is ugly, and the columns might need renaming. Ignore the design. The focus right now is that the math, the product selection logic, and the ROI stats are happening automatically.



If this logic works for you, we can move forward to "skin" the PDF with ANC’s official branding and finalize the layout.



Let me know what you think.



Best, Ahmad

That’s so cool! Would love to show you my specific template and specs / pricing line items I use to get a quote. What’s your availability for tomorrow?

To get your quote that is. I’m presenting to my boss on Monday so Friday will work as well for a short 15 min call

Ahmad Basheer
12:28 AM
Hi Natalia,



Yes, I would love to talk tomorrow. I am flexible, so please choose whatever time works best for you and send the invite.



To be honest, I wasn't sure if you changed your mind about sharing the files or if you meant you wanted to show them to me during the call.



If you are comfortable sending the template and pricing specs now, I definitely prefer that. It would let me load your data and connect the logic tonight. That way, instead of just talking about it, I can make sure everything works perfectly so you have a live, working demo to show your manager on Monday.



I am happy to sign an NDA immediately if that makes you feel more comfortable sharing the files.



Let me know what you prefer!



Best, Ahmad

here are 2 files i can share - one is how we have specs, second is final product. while it is a good example, i reducted a lot of info so maybe easier to talk it through on the call.

Also, i did not bother with math to work, meaning excel cost does not match PDF cost, and of course they will on the actual proposal. I also did not include tabs that explain Structural Materials, Structural Labor and LED Installation, Electrical and Data - Materials and Subcontracting, Project Management, General Conditions, Travel & Expenses, Submittals, Engineering, and Permits, Content Management System Equipment, Installation, and Commissioning

actual exel cost sheet has tab for each

5:30 PM
i am not sure what i was looking at. I imagine opening some type of software and adding a prompt/software receives notification from Salesforse. 2. i add all the questions i am prompted to/software extracts from excel/salesforce. 3. software matches answers to the correct product in the excel catalog. 4 software applies margin i asked for. 5. software calculates sipping, project management etc etc . 5. software generates pDF

i do not have 11:30 its booked now. Please send invite to 11 am est or 1:30 est

7:13 PM
Hi Natalia,



Thank you again for the call today – walking through your current workflow and constraints was incredibly valuable. It is clear now that we are not just building a document generator, but a full Estimator Logic Engine that needs to handle complex variables (Structural, Labor, PM, etc.) and produce dual outputs (client-facing PDF + internal audit Excel).
​



To give you a realistic timeline and an accurate fixed‑price proposal, I’ll need to go through the “source material” so I can map out the logic in detail and mirror the math your Estimators already trust.
​



Please send the following when you’re able:
​



The NDA: So we can share unredacted files freely.



The “Master” Excel: Specifically the tabs you mentioned (like the Install tab) that contain the formulas for Structural, Labor, PM, and related cost calculations, so I can see exactly how the math works and replicate it.



The “Internal” output example: An example of the “ugly Excel” backup file your Estimators use to audit the numbers, so the internal view matches how they currently review and validate a quote.



Brand assets for the PDF skin:



High‑res ANC logo (PNG or SVG).



Brand color codes (Hex or RGB values for the ANC blue).



Font details: Either the .ttf / .otf files if you use a non‑standard font, or the font names if they are standard system or Adobe/Google fonts.



Anything else you think I should review (for example, a representative “full” cost sheet with all tabs, or notes your Estimators use when validating complex projects) would also be very helpful to make sure the engine reflects how your team really works.
​



Once I receive these, I will map out the architecture for the Estimator Logic Engine and then send over the formal proposal with the timeline we discussed on the call.
​



Best regards,
Ahmad

Hello Ahmad, unfortunately i did not get a permitting to share our installation logic sheets so please provide a proposal without

assume that those will be a series of question that have formula ttached to each possibility to calculate

Hi Natalia,



Thank you for the detailed discovery conversation on January 8th. Based on your workflow and requirements, I've prepared two distinct implementation paths for automating ANC's proposal process.



Option 1 delivers a specialized Estimator Engine ($2,500) that replaces your manual Excel quoting workflow with a fast, accurate CPQ tool. It solves the immediate "5-minute quote" problem. You can try a live demo here: https://natalia-natalia2.x0uyzh.easypanel.host/



Option 2 deploys the full ANC Enterprise Platform ($4,000) — the Estimator Engine plus a complete AI operating system that includes document intelligence (RAG), agent automation, CRM integration, and multi-user workspaces. It solves not just quoting, but knowledge management, collaboration, and business automation.



Both options include implementation and training. For ongoing support, we offer flexible options:



$500/month retainer (Recommended: includes hosting, updates, 2-hour response time)



Hourly billing at $150/hr (If you prefer pay-as-you-go for occasional updates)



Attached are two detailed SOWs (Statement of Work) that specify:



Exact technical capabilities & how they work



Implementation timeline & deliverables



Data security & compliance terms



Payment schedule & support options



Deployment & API requirements (we can handle these or you can bring your own)



I recommend reviewing Option 1 first to understand the core CPQ logic, then Option 2 to see the full ecosystem.



Next step: Let me know which direction resonates, and we can schedule a kickoff meeting to finalize the technical requirements and timeline.



Looking forward to partnering with ANC.

Question for you, once we sign with you and you give us access to the platform, do we need to pay any yearly fee to keep the access?

Ahmad Basheer
4:37 AM
Hi Natalia,



Great question. I want to be 100% transparent so you can explain this clearly to your team.



The short answer: No. Unlike Salesforce or other SaaS products, there is no yearly licensing fee to use the software. Once you pay the one-time implementation fee, you own the solution.



The detailed answer (Operational Costs): While there are no licensing fees payable to me, there are two "keep the lights on" costs to run the platform, which you would pay regardless of who built it:



1. Hosting (The Engine) The software needs a server to run on.



If I host it (Managed): This is covered by the $500/month retainer I proposed. I handle the servers, backups, and uptime.



If ANC hosts it (Self-Hosted): You pay $0 to me for hosting. Your IT team would simply deploy the code to your own cloud (AWS, Azure, etc.) and pay the raw server costs directly to them.



2. AI Usage (The Fuel) The system uses AI models (like OpenAI) to process the logic. These services charge by "usage" (tokens).



Based on your volume, this usually runs $20 - $50 per month total. You pay this directly to the AI provider.



Summary for your boss:



License Fee: $0 (Perpetual ownership).



Maintenance: Optional (Use my retainer for peace of mind, or use your internal IT).



Operational Cost: Low (Small monthly server/API bills).



Regarding the Demo: Since you’ve been playing with the sandbox—if you noticed a specific feature or logic step that is missing but would be critical for your team to see on Wednesday, please let me know. I’d be happy to assess it this weekend; if it’s doable, I can try to add it in before your meeting so you have an even more compelling prototype to present.



Good luck with the prep, and let me know if you need anything else!



Best regards,

Ahmad Basheer
4:57 PM
Hi Natalia,



No worries at all! It looks like the "Sandbox" server simply ran out of memory and timed out. This happens occasionally on these smaller test environments when they get busy.



I just restarted the server and tested it myself—it is back up and running perfectly. You can see it working here: https://www.loom.com/share/910675d1a8bb413494790e8ec735debb



However, this is where I could really use your input.



I built this current version using the limited information I had available. It works, but to make this an autonomous, genuinely helpful agent that saves you hours of work, I need your feedback on "what needs to be done" inside the logic.



The more specific guidance you can give me (e.g., "Adjust this margin," "Ask this question first," "Don't recommend X product for Y venue"), the smarter the system gets.



Let me know if you can spot any logic gaps before your meeting on Wednesday!



Best,



Ahmad

i think this demo is a perfect tool to pitch your services to my boss, in my mind you went above and beyond. I do not think any more of your free resources should be used to make this sale. Once we sign the deal, we will schedule indepth meetings with estimators to go over all of this.

Ahmad Basheer
5:28 PM
Hi Natalia — thank you, that means a lot.



And please don’t worry at all about “free resources.” Building this demo helped validate the architecture and gave me a much clearer view of your workflow, so it’s genuinely a win on my side too.
​



Whenever you’ve had a chance to align with your team, just let me know how you’d like to proceed and I’ll follow your lead.
​



Also, at any point if you feel something needs to be tweaked for clarity, please feel completely free to ping me and I’ll get it done — no stress at all.
​



In the meantime, I’ll upgrade the demo server memory so you don’t run into any trouble during testing.

i see that you added this section to the demo - o thinks its better to remove and rework later. The reason being all this little symbols ets do not look "professional" enough and do not send right message. clean no extra info look you had before will go better with the crowd.

Ahmad Basheer
11:07 AM
Hi Natalia,



Attached is the proposal for the ANC Enterprise Estimator Platform, tailored around your current Excel estimating workflow and branded “Budget Proposal” documents. The platform converts your Master Excel formulas into a secure backend “ANC Calculator,” so every quote runs the same trusted math, while estimators work through a simple chat-style interface or by uploading RFP PDFs/blueprints.
​



Each request generates two outputs: a strictly branded client PDF with summary pricing only, and an internal Excel audit file with full calculation details for your senior estimators. The implementation is structured over four weeks (logic integration, document engine, platform setup, and deployment/UAT) with a fixed 4,000 USD development fee via Upwork milestones and a 500 USD/month operational retainer covering hosting, AI usage, and minor logic updates.
​



To begin, I’ll just need the signed NDA, the unredacted Master Excel, and your brand assets (logo and fonts); once you accept the offer, you can send the NDA and i time to schedule the short “Logic Mapping” workshop.

Hi Ahmad, reviewed the proposal with the team.

Can you please add the 800/month with 3 hours a day option and indicate how many hours go into the 500/mnth

Friday, Jan 16
Ahmad Basheer
12:15 AM
Hi Natalia,



Thanks for reviewing the proposal and for the detailed feedback. Here is a clear breakdown of the monthly options and what is included in each.
​



Monthly structure
Base Operational Retainer: 500 USD/month (ongoing)



Launch Accelerator Add‑On: +800 USD (first 30 days only)



After the first 30 days, only the 500 USD/month operational retainer continues unless we separately agree on new feature packages.
​



What the 500 USD/month includes
The 500 USD/month is a fixed operational retainer that covers roughly 3–4 hours per month of ongoing care and minor adjustments to keep the system healthy and aligned with your estimators.
​



Covered under this retainer:



Infrastructure & hosting: VPS, vector database, backups, security patches, monitoring.
​



Maintenance: Uptime monitoring, bug fixes, and small logic tweaks (e.g., updating a labor rate or margin formula).
​



Support: Troubleshooting issues, answering user questions, and onboarding/training new estimators.
​



API management: Integrating and securely storing your OpenAI/Anthropic keys, with ANC paying token usage directly to the provider (no markup).
​



Anything that fits into those ~3–4 hours/month is included in the retainer at no extra cost; larger requests that go beyond that are treated as new scoped features and quoted separately.
​



800 USD Launch Accelerator (first 30 days)
The 800 USD is a one‑time, launch‑phase add‑on for the first 30 days only.
​



It gives you a dedicated 3 hours per day during that first month, focused exclusively on building and refining new features rather than day‑to‑day support.
​



Think of it as a fast‑track implementation window where we can move quickly with your estimators and leadership to tune the logic, add workflows, and respond to real‑world feedback.
​



Examples of what can be done under this 800 USD launch pool:



Building a Salesforce integration to push approved quotes.
​



Adding a new module (for example, a Media Player pricing module).
​



Creating custom PDF templates (e.g., for RISE projects).
​



Migrating data from an older estimating system.
​



Adding a multi‑language toggle for proposals.
​



New features vs support
To keep things transparent for your team, here is how “New Features” vs “Support” is handled.
​



New Features (draw down from the 800 USD pool in month one, then quoted as fixed lump sums after month one):



New modules or workflows



New external integrations



New PDF templates or output types



Larger data migrations or structural changes to the Estimator Engine
​



Support (included in the 500 USD/month):



System downtime or errors



Changing a labor rate or margin value in the existing calculator



Questions like “How do I generate a ribbon board proposal?”



Fixing a PDF that did not generate correctly



Adding or removing a user account
​



After day 30
After the first 30 days, the 800 USD launch accelerator ends automatically.
​



The platform continues under the 500 USD/month operational retainer for hosting, maintenance, and support.
​



Any new feature requests after that are handled as fixed, one‑time quotes per feature or bundle (no hourly surprises).
​



If this structure looks good, the next step on my side is to update the written proposal to explicitly list:



500 USD/month operational retainer (~3–4 support/maintenance hours per month).



Optional 800 USD launch accelerator for the first 30 days (3 hours/day for new features only).
​



Best,
Ahmad

and waht would be hourly/monthly rate month 2-12

can you please add all this into PDF and resend?

Ahmad Basheer
3:24 PM
Hi Natalia,



Let me lay out the complete breakdown and answer your question about Months 2–12.



DEVELOPMENT FEE: $4,000 (one-time)



$2,000 due Day 1 (contract signing) – I start building immediately



$2,000 due at project completion – when you approve the delivered platform



Timeline: 4 weeks from kickoff to go-live



OPTIONAL LAUNCH ACCELERATOR: $800 (one-time, first 30 days only)
This is a goodwill “launch boost” if you want extra firepower in Month 1.



You get 3 hours/day for one month focused on new features and enhancements (e.g. Salesforce integration, new modules, custom PDFs, etc.).



Completely optional. You don’t need this to use the core platform.



After this first 30‑day accelerator period ends, any new feature you decide to add later (beyond what we already scoped) will be quoted separately on a per‑feature basis, after we discuss it and agree on scope and price.



ONGOING OPERATIONAL RETAINER: $500/month
This is the only recurring fee from Month 2 through Month 12. There is just one 500/month, not two.



Covers hosting, infrastructure, monitoring, backups, and security.



Includes support, bug fixes, and minor logic tweaks.



Includes roughly 3–4 hours per month of this support/maintenance work.



There are no other recurring monthly fees in Months 2–12. The $800 accelerator is a one-time, optional add‑on for the first month only.



Is this what you were looking for? If yes, I’ll update the proposal and regenerate the PDF immediately. If anything is still unclear or you want to adjust the structure, let me know

Ahmad Basheer
3:30 PM
So just to summarize in simple terms:



$2,000 on Day 0 (contract start)



$2,000 around Day 30 (or whenever the project is delivered and approved)



Then $500 per month from Months 2–12 for hosting, maintenance, and support



Optional $800 add‑on for one month only at the start if you want me to spend 2–3 extra hours per day on new features during that month



There are no other recurring fees beyond the single $500/month in Months 2–12.
If this is okay and answers your question, let me know and I'll draft the PDF immediately. If you need any clarification, let me know.



Best,
Ahmad

NK
Natalia Kovaleva
3:47 PM
$2,000 on Day 0 (contract start)



$2,000 around Day 30 (or whenever the project is delivered and approved)



Then $500 per month from Months 2–12 for hosting, maintenance, and support



Optional $800 add‑on for one month only at the start if you want me to spend 2–3 extra hours per day on new features during that month

this is good. Hourly rate of x/hour should additional features be needed outside of basic hosting, maintenance, and support

Ahmad Basheer
3:54 PM
On the hourly part:
I actually wouldn’t want to charge you hourly for new features, because in many cases that ends up less fair to you and harder to predict on your side. Instead, whenever you want a new feature beyond basic hosting, maintenance, and support, we can walk through the requirement together and I’ll propose a clear fixed price per feature, so you know the full cost upfront with no surprises.



If you or your finance team prefer to work with an hourly model, I can also accommodate that and share an hourly rate, but my default recommendation is fixed, per‑feature pricing so it stays simple and transparent for you.

Ahmad Basheer
4:07 PM
Would you like me to draft the final PDF with the following structure:



$2,000 upfront on Day 0 (contract start)



$2,000 upon finalizing and delivering the project (around Day 30, or earlier if approved sooner)



Optional $800 for one month, dedicated to 2–3 hours per day of new feature development



$500/month from Months 2–12 as a recurring fee for hosting, maintenance, and support



Any additional features beyond that would be billed separately at a fixed per‑feature price, after we discuss and agree on the scope and cost



If this matches what you have in mind, I’ll update the proposal and generate the final PDF accordingly.

NK
Natalia Kovaleva
4:16 PM
Payment Terms: $2,000 upon signing the Contract



$2,000 upon final completion



OPTIONAL LAUNCH ACCELERATOR: $800 (one-time, first 30 days only)
3 hours/day for one month focused on new features and enhancements (e.g. Salesforce integration, new modules, custom PDFs, etc.).



$500/month from Months 2–12 as a recurring fee for hosting, maintenance, and support - includes 3-4 hours /month of support work.

Ahmad Basheer
4:30 PM
Hi Natalia,



Attached is the final PDF proposal reflecting the payment structure we discussed.
​



Next steps to kick off:
​



Send the offer: Please set up the contract on Upwork with 2 milestones ($2k / $2k).
​



Mobilization: Once I accept the offer, you can release Milestone 1 immediately. This will trigger the official start date and cover server provisioning and initial setup.
​



Onboarding: I will sign the NDA and join your Slack so we can schedule the Logic Workshop.
​



I am ready to start building as soon as the contract is active. Please let me know if you have any trouble setting up the milestones on your end.

Best,
Ahmad

Hi Natalia,



Received and reviewed. Please find the countersigned NDA attached.
Two quick confirmations to align with the clauses:



Security (Clause 8): As discussed, all data will be hosted on the secure VPS environment, not stored on local personal devices.



AI Usage (Clause 9): We will proceed using the secure OpenAI/Anthropic APIs as outlined in the SOW (which, unlike public ChatGPT, do not use client data for model training).



Next Steps:



Milestone: Please activate the Milestone 1 ($2,000) on Upwork.
Data: Once active, please send over the unredacted Master Excel files and the Brand Assets (Logo/Fonts) so I can begin the logic mapping immediately.



Ready to get to work!

12:41 AM
Hi Natalia,



Since the original job post was set to Hourly, Upwork’s interface will likely default to that structure. To make sure the contract reflects the Fixed Price agreement we discussed, here is how to set it up:



1. Switch the contract to Fixed Price
In our Upwork message room, click “Hire” / “Send Offer”.
​



At the top of the offer screen, change the contract type from Hourly to Fixed Price using the tab/toggle.
​



Enter $4,000 as the Total Amount.
​



2. Configure the milestones
When prompted how you want to pay:



Choose “Pay by Milestone”.
​



Add the two milestones as follows:



Milestone 1 – $2,000



Description: “Mobilization & Setup”



Milestone 2 – $2,000



Description: “Final Delivery & UAT”



3. Activate the project
Once you send the offer, I will accept it right away.
​



Upwork will then ask you to fund Milestone 1 and give you the option to Release it.
​



Please go ahead and release the first milestone immediately; that will trigger server/hosting procurement and mark the official project start.
​



We can keep the Retainer / Launch Accelerator as a separate agreement later, so this initial contract stays clean and focused on the build.
​



If anything in the interface is unclear or behaves differently on your side, let me know and I’ll adapt to whatever screen you are seeing.
​



Best,
Ahmad

Ahmad, did you reword the file to reflect?

Ahmad Basheer
12:57 AM
Hi Natalia,



No, I signed the standard version you sent without altering the legal text inside the PDF.
Reasoning: Since Clause 9 allows AI usage “with prior written approval,” my email confirmation combined with our SOW serves as that written approval. This usually keeps Legal happier than editing their template.



Action: If your team strictly prefers that I write the exception inside the document itself, just let me know and I will add a note to Clause 9 and re-sign it right now

NK

12:58 AM
whats the proposed line? ill bring to legal to confirm

Ahmad Basheer
1:02 AM
Hi Natalia,



Here is the specific line to add to Clause 9. This distinguishes between the secure tools we are using versus the public tools they are worried about.



Proposed Wording:



"Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client grants Freelancer permission to use secure third-party APIs (specifically OpenAI and Anthropic) solely for the purpose of executing the Scope of Work, provided that such usage is configured to exclude Client Confidential Information from model training."



Context for Legal:
This confirms we are using the Enterprise/API tier (which guarantees Zero Data Retention), not the public ChatGPT interface.

Ahmad
