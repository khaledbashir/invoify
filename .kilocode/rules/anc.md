Document Status: Knowledge Base Consolidated — Ready for Coder Handoff
ANC Studio is an AI-powered proposal generation system for large-format LED display
projects (stadiums, arenas, entertainment venues). It transforms complex RFP documents
and technical specifications into branded, client-ready sales proposals with:
1. Manual data entry errors from 2,500-page RFP documents
2. Financial misalignment between Excel calculations and client PDFs
3. Unprofessional proposals that leak internal costs/margins to clients
4. Lost bid history — no centralized vault for past proposals
5. Slow turnaround — weeks to generate a single proposal manually

Table 4: Data source strategy for inputs
Project-Level Costs:
Structural Tonnage:
Example Allocation:
Screen A: 15 tons × $3,000 = $45,000 structural cost
Screen B: 8 tons × $3,000 = $24,000 structural cost
Project-Level PM: $50,000 (line item, not allocated)
Margin Bounds:
Input Highlighting (Audit Excel):
Alternate Row Skipping (Mirror Mode):
5.2 Data Source Strategy
5.3 Allocation Rules
• Listed as distinct line items (NOT spread into per-screen costs)
• Why: Maintains transparency for Internal Audit Excel
• Mapped to specific screens or zones (e.g., "South End Zone")
• Cost Basis: Tonnage × $3,000/ton → "Structural Materials" cost
5.4 Rounding & Formatting
• Rounding Point: At total level for each pricing category (Subtotal, Tax, Final Total)
• Decimal Places: Two decimals for all currency (\$125,000.00)
• Method: Banker's rounding (HALF_EVEN) to minimize bias in repeated calculations
• Placeholders: If input missing → show [PROJECT TOTAL] (not \$0.00)
5.5 Guardrails
• Minimum: 0.0 (0%)
• Maximum: <1.0 (<100%)
• If user enters ≥1.0 → block with error message
• Yellow-highlighted cells: margin %, steel cost basis, B&O rate, sales tax rate
• Why: Finance can tweak during audit
Accepted File Types:
Size/Page Limits:
Preferred Document Structure:
Multi-Document Handling:
Allowed Auto-Fill Fields:
Confidence Threshold:
Fallback Behavior:
• Rows labeled "ALT" or "Alternate" → automatically skipped

• If confidence <85% → trigger "Gap Fill" questions
• AI cannot identify field → ask user 2-3 direct questions in chat sidebar
• If still unclear → leave field blank with placeholder
Human Verification:
User Queries:
Citations:
Direct Updates:
• Always required before "Approved/Exported" state

6.3 Visual Signals ("Blue Glow")
• Trigger: Field auto-filled by AI (not manually entered)
• Persistence: Until user verifies (clicks/edits/confirms)
• Storage: In-memory metadata (not persisted in DB schema)
• Export Behavior:
– Blue Glow stripped from PDF and Share Link (professional appearance)
– Metadata logged in audit trail (which fields were AI vs human)

Non-Deletable Items:
9. DATA RETENTION & DELETION POLICY
9.1 Retention Periods
• Active/Won bids: Full retention
• Lost/Archived bids: Same retention (vault = permanent history)
9.2 Immutability Rules
• Approved/Exported: PDF and Audit Excel locked (versioned snapshot)
• Shared: Share Link snapshot immutable (deep clone)
• Signed: Proposal + PDF + Audit Excel fully immutable (contractual record)
• Signed version can NEVER be edited
• To make changes → clone signed version into new Draft → start new lifecycle
9.3 Deletion Rules
• Admin: Files, versions, entire workspaces (restricted action)
• Estimator/Proposal Lead: Cannot delete (create/edit only)
• Soft Delete (default): Archiving, recoverable
• Hard Delete: Generally not allowed (violates "no data lost" principle)
• Executed contracts (Signed proposals)
If Link Expires/Revoked:
Regeneration Rules:
Q10.1: Is "Message Log / Proof of Play" in-scope for ANC Studio MVP, or only for installed
signage platform (post-sale operations)?
Q10.2: For proposal share links, confirm exact event types to log: Page view? Section view?
PDF download? Executed-PDF download? Signature start? Signature complete? Link
revoked-but-attempted?
Q10.3: Confirm identifiers + retention for share link analytics: Store full IP for how many
days, then mask? Store device fingerprint only if signature enabled? What anonymization
rules after X years?
Q10.4: Confirm exports for analytics: Excel (.xlsx) required for share link analytics? Or
only for proof-of-play (signage ops)?
Q10.5: Where does 15-year portal live: Within ANC Studio (Project Vault) only? Separate
vendor-hosted portal linked out?
Q10.6: When RAG extracts tonnage from TTE reports, what's the exact pattern matching
logic? Current: (\d+) tons. What if report says "15.5 tons" or "fifteen tons" or "15 T"?
Q10.7: "Outsider (Subcontractor/Installer)" defined but not in Permission Matrix —
confirm exact permissions: Can view/edit only assigned technical fields? Cannot see totals,
margin, costs, or export/share?
• Signature evidence (audit trails)
• Audit logs (append-only)
9.4 Share Link Retention
• Snapshot retained for project's audit window
• Access logs retained for 15 years
• Can generate new link for existing version (new hash)
• Can generate link for new version
• Cannot "update" link in place
10. OPEN QUESTIONS
10.1 Analytics & Reporting
10.2 Structural Tonnage Extraction
10.3 Outsider Role Scope
Q10.8: Current matrix shows "Product Expert can edit financial inputs" — is this
intentional? If not, restrict to catalog + technical only (avoid toxic permission
combination).
Q10.9: If any Blue Glow remains, does system: Block "Approved/Exported" state (P0)? Allow
export with warning (P1)?
Q10.10: "OCR to see technical drawings/BIM models" — define exact scope: Do we truly
parse BIM (e.g., Revit API)? Or accept related exports (PDF schedules, CSV takeoffs) and
treat BIM as attachments?
Q10.11: When "Gap Fill" asks 2-3 questions, what's max retries before forcing manual
entry?
