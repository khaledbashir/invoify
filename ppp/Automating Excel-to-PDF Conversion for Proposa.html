<h2 id="date-1-27-2026">Date: 1/27/2026</h2>
<p>[00:01] Estimators can actually explain you what they&#39;re looking for. So do not spend too much time working on anything estimation related because like I want you to talk to them to see how to make it customized for them so you don&#39;t have to like redo multiple times. So don&#39;t don&#39;t worry about it. I can walk you through proposals today and you will have like a full picture of what needs to happen there and you&#39;ll have like an opportunity to work on that piece.</p>
<p>[00:29] And then tomorrow once you talk to estimators they will talk to you about different pieces of what goes into their work and then you may have to like go back and do things so just don&#39;t don&#39;t worry about coming with anything like prepared. I got it. The expectation that they have that you haven&#39;t seen anything yet, so they will have to work and explain everything to you from scratch. So don&#39;t worry about it. Yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p>[00:54] Okay. Yeah, of course. No, this is like a first meeting where my expectation my expectation of you is you know nothing yet, so</p>
<p>[01:02] So I start from the beginning. Um we talked about kind of having this engine to work for both estimation and proposals.</p>
<p>[01:14] However, there will be many many cases that estimator will do estimation himself, and then I will be needing to send an Excel to your system and say</p>
<p>[01:30] So this would be I would say 75% of the time it&#39;s gonna be that. The calculations that you&#39;re gonna be running with your software they&#39;re gonna be original preliminary budgets and um</p>
<p>[01:46] The first time client comes to us we usually do that. We&#39;re like, hey, let me give you like a rough idea. But then once we work with them, actual estimator will start working on the project and he will start pricing it with all the little details. They won&#39;t be able to show you. And it&#39;s their job to do that. So we&#39;re also not looking to take away their job completely.</p>
<p>[02:09] I so in many many cases either they already work for that I think it already existed because the client came to us three months ago and now he came back saying like okay I&#39;m ready to purchase now.</p>
<p>[02:23] Um</p>
<p>[02:24] So the</p>
<p>[02:26] Sun to yesterday</p>
<p>[02:29] This Excel is a perfect example of that. So we have been kind of like in touch with this guy for a while and he sent us this Excel with Emilium screens</p>
<p>[02:42] Uh the screen&#39;s allocated right here on LED sheet.</p>
<p>[02:47] So what I would need somewhere to do is to take all of this information and to put in our templates. Versus me right now I go to In Design and I type every screen like that. Like a screen and then specification. Screen and specification. I won&#39;t completely avoid that part. Because there&#39;s no reason for me to type anything. Correct.</p>
<p>[03:13] uh all information is already there. So Excel&#39;s uh for now look like this. Uh once you talk to estimators if you tell them like</p>
<p>[03:24] Okay, software can work with that, but can I add the column here? Can I move color columns around? I&#39;m sure they will say yes, but you have to ask a ask that question to them. I don&#39;t know that answer.</p>
<p>[03:36] This is the template. So the way it works for me is I see this name here on the display equals some type of RFP. So this is the name that the construction manager assigned to this screen.</p>
<p>[03:51] We have to keep this name because otherwise construction manager won&#39;t understand what the pricing and specification are related to.</p>
<p>[04:01] Uh this would be a case of just a budget or a proposal. It&#39;s not an LOI. He still has like a millions of screens, they&#39;re not gonna purchase all of them, they&#39;re just seeing what&#39;s gonna be for their budget.</p>
<p>[04:13] So for the PDF page, it will say and C is pleased to present the following proposal to our Chicago Fire Stadium.</p>
<p>[04:25] Uh Chicago Fire Stadium is the client and once we start using your software we can talk uh about</p>
<p>[04:33] where to keep the names so the software reads it accurately because here they said uh 100% design drawings cost analysis just because for now I just manually type this name I don&#39;t need it to be like completely accurate but once we use the software we can just type here in a project name Chicago Fire Stadium</p>
<p>[04:56] And all of those screens, I need specification for all of those screens.</p>
<p>[05:00] So here</p>
<p>[05:03] When it this is a different full</p>
<p>[05:05] So it says full of theme, H will display one, which will say this.</p>
<p>[05:15] Here.</p>
<p>[05:22] And then specification we&#39;ll go here.</p>
<p>[05:27] So 10mm, 295, 17, 170p is good, and then pigs of counters.</p>
<p>[05:35] So question for you</p>
<p>[05:37] For now we used to do it like this. For some reason when I started working in this company million years ago, they put display name of top and specification kind of in a column.</p>
<p>[05:49] But in reality, I&#39;m open to keep it all in one line if it&#39;s gonna make a difference for you.</p>
<p>[05:58] Um It doesn&#39;t matter actually. It doesn&#39;t matter? Okay, so then we can keep it in a column because that&#39;s everyone is used to that system.</p>
<p>[06:07] So out of this spreadsheet that you will receive from estimator, you will need the column A, column E, column F, G, H, and J.</p>
<p>[06:21] And it&#39;s always the same. Column E always has pixel count, column F always has height for display, column G always has the width form display, and H and G always have a pixel count.</p>
<p>[06:36] Since we&#39;re building this software, I would add the LED brightness, which is a column M. We don&#39;t currently use it, but very often clients will come back to me later and say what&#39;s the brightness and I&#39;ll just manually add another line.</p>
<p>[06:54] So since we&#39;re building this we can add this to be there all the time. And then if there&#39;s no brightness provided, just don&#39;t if this comment for some reason is left empty, don&#39;t use that spec.</p>
<p>[07:10] Natalia, if you can bear with me just uh</p>
<p>[07:26] I do</p>
<p>[07:32] and applying to those or do do do do do do do do do do do you</p>
<p>[07:48] Okay, I can definitely we can definitely go back and talk about it.</p>
<p>[07:51] But I also want to make sure you understand that</p>
<p>[07:55] uh we will have that full circle opportunity that I&#39;m gonna walk you through in a moment of how we receive the project and this and this and that but I also need a software to say bypass all of this and just do a PDF based on this itself</p>
<p>[08:14] So for this particular exercise, you really don&#39;t care where all this information is coming from. The only thing I&#39;m looking for software is to take this information to turn it into a BDF. And like I said, about 70% of the exercise will be just like that.</p>
<p>[08:33] We&#39;re only gonna be using the software for full calculations occasionally, but the most important piece is to take any Excel and to turn it to PDF.</p>
<p>[08:44] And uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh we can I want you to talk to estimators about how they got opportunities because they are getting opportunities and that&#39;s what the call tomorrow will be about. They will talk you through their process of they receive an RFP and then they send information to sobs and what kind of information they send to sobs so you can figure out how you can out-timate all of those pieces.</p>
<p>[09:09] I&#39;m not very familiar and I don&#39;t want to waste my time and your time talking about that. So the goal tomorrow will be about that. How we get all the information and then the e eventually how we arrive to this Excel. But like I said, at some point very often I will be just opening your software and saying bypass all the calculations, this is an Excel. I need it to be a proposal client is Chicago fire. And then I&#39;m dropping this Excel and you</p>
<p>[09:39] Do you read a PDF for me? I see. Okay. Make sense? Makes perfect sense. Yeah.</p>
<p>[09:45] Yeah, so the when talking right now only about the PDF piece because like I told you when we were kind of meeting I work with the proposals and they are doing estimates. So I don&#39;t wanna I know how they work, but I want to make sure they tell you about specific things like how they set growth subcontractors, what scope of work, like they will show you specific uh sections of the RP, how they come up with a scope of work, all of that is gonna be tomorrow. So again zero expectations for you to have anything ready for tomorrow. Don&#39;t even look at any formals or nothing like this. The only thing we are focusing on right now is uh how to set up the uh uh software that it takes Excel and make it a PDF. For my boss tax, let me see what it was. Okay</p>
<p>[10:48] One second.</p>
<p>[10:49] Should I take it then?</p>
<p>[11:30] Okay.</p>
<p>[11:31] Uh so we so I receive this Excel, nobody cares for this specific exercise how we arrived at this number. We&#39;re just gonna take this number and make it a PDF. So</p>
<p>[11:45] This is gonna be a proposal. And we can uh say that this is gonna be LEG display proposal. We don&#39;t have to specify marquee, this and that. I don&#39;t really know what that means this LED. This is some type of like screen. This is the number they gave it. We don&#39;t care, we&#39;re just gonna copy this number.</p>
<p>[12:06] Uh</p>
<p>[12:10] Okay, so this from the specification on this page for every single screen that list appear I always need millimeter page display size width pixel count pixel width and we said we&#39;re gonna add LED needs which is called brightness so here it says LED needs requirements</p>
<p>[12:32] Uh L E D</p>
<p>[12:35] requirements in specification table</p>
<p>[12:39] Should say brightness.</p>
<p>[12:45] Rightness.</p>
<p>[12:47] Okay, so first portion of the PDF that we&#39;re building will be specifications.</p>
<p>[12:54] And all of those specifications will be listed here.</p>
<p>[12:58] Because I manually do this one sometimes I see that lockable ribbon has like two sections short and long and I will put it together but I don&#39;t expect software to kinda go that deep as long as every single line item from here is listed like this</p>
<p>[13:17] like name of the display and then specification I&#39;m fine with that. I don&#39;t hear that it kind of like combines pieces together whatever it&#39;s fine</p>
<p>[13:28] Okay. So then once once we do that for the PDF, the only other tab we qu carry about we the only other tab we uh</p>
<p>[13:39] Yeah, that concerned us is called margin analysis.</p>
<p>[13:43] Sometimes they put LED display in front of marginal analysis, sometimes marginal analysis is out there, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s kind of like depends, but those are two tabs that we cared about.</p>
<p>[13:54] Now this stuff can be a little bit tricky because sometimes</p>
<p>[13:59] Like in this case</p>
<p>[14:02] Um</p>
<p>[14:05] It&#39;s a combined ease.</p>
<p>[14:08] Meaning every single thing that you saw on that page of LED display they wanna purchase as one thing</p>
<p>[14:16] Which happens but not that often. So they say this is like a budget. So what they&#39;re trying to understand is how much it&#39;s gonna cost them to build that stadium. And we&#39;re saying LED display will be about twenty million dollars to be the to to to to to to to to to to bu build that in a stadium.</p>
<p>[14:35] Uh and then eventually when they come back they will want to see how much it&#39;s gonna cost to build every single screen as a separate um thing. So let me see if I have this sheet like that to open the show.</p>
<p>[14:51] Um</p>
<p>[15:11] Okay, so let me take a little bit of a step back. So software needs to be having some type of intelligence because uh on the margin analysis on on the spec section it&#39;s all very straightforward. But when it comes to margin analysis there will be a lot of variations. Let&#39;s say this is one speed, but then we have two alternatives that they put here. So somehow software will need to see what margin analysis is saying exactly. And uh</p>
<p>[15:43] kind of analyze it I don&#39;t know how and uh</p>
<p>[15:48] and build it exactly like margin analysis is uh doing.</p>
<p>[15:53] So is that possible?</p>
<p>[15:56] Uh y it uh it it it is possible, but could you could you walk me through that again, one more time?</p>
<p>[16:03] Again.</p>
<p>[16:04] Yeah of course. So uh this let&#39;s say this</p>
<p>[16:09] Uh I&#39;m trying to see. So see how this this this this this this this this this this this sheet is very deep right</p>
<p>[16:15] Uh we have uh screens that we have specification for and this speech is very straightforward like I said this is always gonna be name this is always gonna be pixel fee active display this active display that and pixel count everything is very standardized so there&#39;s no oh I I forgot to tell you quantity of screens were also</p>
<p>[16:37] So we need this, this this this I I will follow up with all the uh all the uh um</p>
<p>[16:44] columns that we need to see but um it&#39;s always in the same spot there&#39;s no variation</p>
<p>[16:52] But when it comes to margin analysis it&#39;s always very different. So for this particular margin analysis, we are selling center honey. You know what center hungry is? I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>[17:05] You know like in arenas there&#39;s this big like round screen in the middle of the arena so you can see when you sit. Ah, okay.</p>
<p>[17:13] That&#39;s called center heart. So that center screen is built made with many different screens. It&#39;s not like the one continuous thing. In this particular um</p>
<p>[17:25] This particular design has the four screens and then it has like a top ribbon that&#39;s gonna be having some type of like sponsoring and then there&#39;s a bottom rebutton</p>
<p>[17:39] So we it&#39;s all build like one LED display, but we have to list all of those screens</p>
<p>[17:48] And then on top of that, we&#39;re also saying that we can build this center hunt with a different pixel features. So let&#39;s say we propose um a four millimeter, but if you want to be additional 270 three, we will give to you uh 2.5 millimeter peach screen. So more fine peach.</p>
<p>[18:10] So software will need to some and these type of calculations I don&#39;t think the software will be doing any time slowly. Maybe eventually once we talk to estimators we will figure out how to like teach it all of that. But this is a rather complex. Oh you mean um Do you mean it uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh what what you were thinking is that um the software</p>
<p>[18:47] We&#39;re still talking about the exercise. Uh</p>
<p>[19:06] Yeah, so you you will have to be you be patient with me because I will need to</p>
<p>[19:13] No, I I I again it&#39;s my my my my my my my my my my my my my now my my my my my my my my my my my</p>
<p>[19:27] If you need I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m available there.</p>
<p>[19:29] No, no, no. Just give me a second. Just hold on one second.</p>
<p>[19:36] Okay.</p>
<p>[19:39] Okay, so what I&#39;m trying to say for now we don&#39;t touch calculations at all. In this conversation today, we will not be um</p>
<p>[19:48] Concerning ourselves how to do any type of calculations. That is not something we worry about today. This is just purely can we take any marginal analysis that looks completely different? It can look like this, like a million screens together, and then one price, or it can look like couple screens together, and then um like um alternatives and then it can be I don&#39;t know something else that we see.</p>
<p>[20:22] Um</p>
<p>[20:32] So this is an another example of marginal analysis that&#39;s opening up right now.</p>
<p>[20:38] You see like how the screens from this that have from LED sheet</p>
<p>[20:45] Okay. I&#39;m trying to open it. So here on the LED sheet you see a lot of screens.</p>
<p>[20:50] Yeah. However, when you go to margin analysis, they are not lumped together to one big price. They are all a separate screens. You can buy Hall of Fame screens, you can buy performance center L CDs, you can buy uh local room screens. So it&#39;s</p>
<p>[21:10] Um</p>
<p>[21:12] They they can be like different uh options and then they on top of it they also added key warranty options</p>
<p>[21:20] So I don&#39;t know how they write to these numbers and you don&#39;t have to worry about how they write to these numbers. Those type of proposals will not be calculated for your software. However, we will need to create a PDF based on this type of Excel.</p>
<p>[21:35] So what I&#39;m trying to say, we need we need to figure out the way that regardless of how marginal analysis looks, it mimics it and transfers it to PDF.</p>
<p>[21:49] So</p>
<p>[21:51] So is the the the the margin analysis might you know, it will you you know, every time will look different. The</p>
<p>[21:59] The the needed is to generate a one uh</p>
<p>[22:12] it it needs to mimic margin analysis. It needs to look exactly like margin analysis. So if they decided to separate screen like that with one number, that&#39;s what the client wants to see. So</p>
<p>[22:27] If I send you this uh Excel, I put it in the software, I want the PDF to have this screen to be the first one to have all of those line items and to have a selling price of this. I understand. Regardless of how it looks.</p>
<p>[22:44] Or this particular</p>
<p>[22:46] So they are the one that is</p>
<p>[22:49] We looked at this one.</p>
<p>[22:51] All of the screens are together. I don&#39;t know why.</p>
<p>[22:54] But that&#39;s what I</p>
<p>[22:55] You see? So we need our PDF to look exactly like this.</p>
<p>[23:02] And there&#39;s a bunch of line items like OE scoring, uh, some type of whatever. We really don&#39;t care what it is and we it&#39;s not like something we</p>
<p>[23:14] something we need to like worry about. We just need to make sure we understand that everything the way it is on this Excel needs to be on the PDF.</p>
<p>[23:26] And there&#39;s no concern about pricing, no concern about anything. We&#39;re just concerned about taking Excel and making exact PDF out of whatever Excel looks like.</p>
<p>[23:38] Uh do you mind please if I uh</p>
<p>[23:42] Uh if if if if if if if if if if if I just share my screen quickly with you, I&#39;m gonna go.</p>
<p>[23:46] Because uh yeah, I basically the the way it helps me to work better is if um</p>
<p>[23:58] So</p>
<p>[23:59] I I did this real quick based on all the input.</p>
<p>[24:14] Uh yeah, I don&#39;t do it.</p>
<p>[24:16] Oh look, can you hear my screen?</p>
<p>[24:19] Yeah.</p>
<p>[24:21] Basically like I said this is just to visualize and to help me really</p>
<p>[24:34] L let&#39;s say like for example um if I say A A A A A A A A A A A and C sports here</p>
<p>[24:39] And then I click this. You are done with the whole filling out all these</p>
<p>[24:46] Um</p>
<p>[24:47] G generated the address, uh all of these things.</p>
<p>[24:51] For example.</p>
<p>[24:54] I I hope. Yeah. So that&#39;s one thing.</p>
<p>[25:02] The what what what what what what what what what what what I was thinking</p>
<p>[25:10] If I uh</p>
<p>[25:12] If I do this and I</p>
<p>[25:16] Sure.</p>
<p>[25:26] If I do this, it what will happen, it will really be</p>
<p>[25:31] Excel and all the cards and everything.</p>
<p>[25:34] It will fill all of these. Um whatever is needed.</p>
<p>[25:38] And then I put here just um</p>
<p>[25:40] Uh these are templates</p>
<p>[25:43] The the way I the the the the way I was I uh see it you see this right here?</p>
<p>[25:48] It worked actually, but uh did uh somewhere.</p>
<p>[25:51] Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>[25:52] Um uh yeah it will it will basically fill in everything that is in here so</p>
<p>[26:00] The screens, the all of these things.</p>
<p>[26:04] You know, it will and then you can either you know you can add and and</p>
<p>[26:08] Uh Switch them or you know, all these things.</p>
<p>[26:12] And then we can add to it or whatever. Like I said, this is just for me to to</p>
<p>[26:17] Visualized. Is is this what you have in mind basically or are we on the same page or</p>
<p>[26:25] I mean I have um a little bit of a hard time understanding uh so now you have to bear with me because I&#39;m not understanding what I&#39;m looking at. So you insert the Nexel and then uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh like right now can you not scroll for a second? Yeah yeah so right now it says uh LED thirty by this. So it&#39;s uh screen name, width, height, quantity, peach</p>
<p>[26:50] Um</p>
<p>[26:52] So where this information is gonna go? Uh okay. It&#39;s a it&#39;s this is exactly the Excel. It&#39;s right here and then you click export and then you it you get a PDF. Like that&#39;s the you know m basic main idea. Like I said, it&#39;s another one. Okay, and the uh item description uh</p>
<p>[27:12] Ah here. So for now your PGF doesn&#39;t work, right? When I&#39;m looking at the PDF it&#39;s not working yet. No no no no no no no no no no no not yet. Yeah but the idea is if you click export it will it will eventually will be the brand and uh the the logo and everything in here and everything that you just sent me</p>
<p>[27:30] It will be there. And and</p>
<p>[27:32] you know, basically you get uh it&#39;s uh they call it what you see is what you get. That&#39;s the whole point of the live preview. So if you don&#39;t like anything in here for example you can easily change it in the line or in in in in in in in in in in in the items or in any of these setup. We can add more tabs, we can uh delete, we can do whatever really and then what what what what what what what what what what what I was thinking or what uh the plan uh</p>
<p>[28:00] My head was actually but you told me not to worry about it now, so I don&#39;t want to confuse you, but just quickly.</p>
<p>[28:06] Basically you would have an a button an upload button</p>
<p>[28:10] And you would uh drag and drop or upload the RFP itself. It reads it and it may maybe it extracts everything. But I think that&#39;s another conversation with the with the estimators because that&#39;s basically the you know what I was uh like I guess I said just to visualize things.</p>
<p>[28:34] Is this uh are we close on the same page or do do do do do do do do do do do you have any I think so, but w let me send you something. Let me send you something so you can open it. Okay.</p>
<p>[29:05] Okay.</p>
<p>[29:16] I&#39;m sending you an Excel.</p>
<p>[29:35] I think I need to close it so it goes through.</p>
<p>[29:42] Maybe.</p>
<p>[29:43] Okay, so if you wanna um</p>
<p>[29:47] If you wanna open that Excel and uh share the screen</p>
<p>[29:51] Yeah.</p>
<p>[29:58] Or if you want yeah, if you want to open that excel.</p>
<p>[30:02] So</p>
<p>[30:08] Just give me a moment because I&#39;m just having trouble.</p>
<p>[30:10] Yeah I have amazing though.</p>
<p>[30:14] Can you?</p>
<p>[30:16] I&#39;ve been commuted.</p>
<p>[30:18] Uh</p>
<p>[30:21] Uh.</p>
<p>[30:23] I don&#39;t know. Yes. So just bear with me. I I have like many things</p>
<p>[30:51] Yeah, I don&#39;t want to waste your time I&#39;m just downloading the Excel. You&#39;re not wasting my time. I want you to show this. That&#39;s the purpose of this poll. There&#39;s no wasting time. We&#39;re doing exactly what you were hoping to do.</p>
<p>[31:05] Uh if you want I can open the Excel if you can be explored. Yeah, I think.</p>
<p>[31:10] Okay, now we&#39;ll open that and then I&#39;ll open it again.</p>
<p>[31:16] Okay, so</p>
<p>[31:24] Mm.</p>
<p>[31:36] So this is uh what I worked on yesterday. Then uh my my my my my my my my my my my my screen is not that big unfortunately but whatever</p>
<p>[31:46] I don&#39;t see uh I see if I I see this Excel</p>
<p>[31:52] And the um</p>
<p>[32:05] I received this Excel and the parameters was as following.</p>
<p>[32:09] Make it an LOI</p>
<p>[32:12] remove all the alternatives from pricing and uh from uh</p>
<p>[32:18] Um</p>
<p>[32:20] Uh specification page. Which is usually un unusual because usually estimators does all of this. But that&#39;s whatever. They didn&#39;t have time to do it yesterday.</p>
<p>[32:31] So I looked at this, uh, I knew this LOI I I I asked him uh the sales guy who is gonna be the client and he slacked me client&#39;s name because he didn&#39;t put it here. Indiana fever is a location. Location cannot like purchase screen, so I need to know like who is the purchaser. So I asked him who is the purchaser, he gave me the name, so I knew the name, who is the purchasing. He told me not to list any alternatives, so I um sort of</p>
<p>[33:04] Kind all the alternatives for myself.</p>
<p>[33:07] And then I created this PDF.</p>
<p>[33:11] Um this file also didn&#39;t have the uh grand total of all the screens he asked me to do that but that&#39;s also rather unusual. So what what what what what what what what what what what we can focus on is that is an LOI This is the name of the client he gave me like verbally, but he needs to start putting it on Excel obviously. It has this language that I already shared with you that the client located there and Auntie located there. This is the header the way I like it. I don&#39;t need any quarter number, this number, nothing. Name of the client</p>
<p>[33:50] location sales quotation and then this little blurb this is the only thing I want to see up top of my PDF</p>
<p>[33:59] So Logo did I send you.</p>
<p>[34:01] Client, location, sales quotation, and then introduction.</p>
<p>[34:07] There were no notes, so I skip notes.</p>
<p>[34:10] Uh payment turns are this</p>
<p>[34:12] This blur please sign below is a standard legal language, it&#39;s never gonna change.</p>
<p>[34:18] And then signature lines.</p>
<p>[34:20] Uh on one side it is ANC</p>
<p>[34:24] And on the other side it&#39;s clients name and address and signature lines.</p>
<p>[34:29] So whatever you have here up top, whatever you have here in the body of the message is gonna go here on the bottom as a purchaser for them to sign.</p>
<p>[34:39] Okay.</p>
<p>[34:40] So then I went through this sheet, LED display sheet.</p>
<p>[34:45] And I typed in</p>
<p>[34:46] Uh screens.</p>
<p>[34:49] So this is HM display 1, HM display 1, HM display 2, this is HM Display 2.</p>
<p>[34:57] The local room rebound display, which is this one.</p>
<p>[35:00] Uh short and long like I told you I put them together just because the person was doing it so I knew these two are gonna go together</p>
<p>[35:10] Um team store displays, team store display.</p>
<p>[35:15] And then eat you round</p>
<p>[35:18] Shell display is this one</p>
<p>[35:22] Okay.</p>
<p>[35:23] Okay, so uh go ahead. Actually I see a typo, you see here it says uh 1.875 and here it says 1.25. So I made a typo. I see it now, but obviously I didn&#39;t see it yesterday.</p>
<p>[35:41] Yeah going to have it.</p>
<p>[35:49] Good start.</p>
<p>[35:51] So you see why I need this software? Because it&#39;s ridiculous to type so many things. Like, whatever.</p>
<p>[35:56] So uh</p>
<p>[35:58] And then I went to Margin Analysis tab.</p>
<p>[36:01] And exactly how it is here besides the alternatives because he verbally told me not to use them. But we&#39;re gonna put like a normal sheet in the software, we&#39;re not gonna like do stupid stuff like this. I would like remove alternatives to myself before I put it into the software.</p>
<p>[36:19] So everything that&#39;s here like it&#39;s whole of excellent LED display it mimics this little header here. Sorry, uh I&#39;m sorry. You said you would have to remove uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh what before you put it on the software?</p>
<p>[36:34] Well he verbally over the phone told me don&#39;t present any alternatives which are still here CSS alternatives change deep in millimeter peach</p>
<p>[36:44] Okay.</p>
<p>[36:46] Yeah, so I I think it&#39;s gonna be a little bit confusing to kind of explain in reality he was supposed to send me a proper completely correct Excel. So the only expectation I have of that software is if I wh wh wh wh wh wh wh wh wh whatever I put in it exactly is exactly what comes out uh uh after. All this little notes, all this little stupid things that say sal sal sal sal sal sal sal sal sal sales just need to get their ship together and stop doing that. There&#39;s no there&#39;s no expectation of the software to be like this. So what we&#39;re working on is exactly how Excel looks is exactly how PDF comes out. So he could put it in the software and get the PDF with all the extra lines, it&#39;s his problem. He needed to submit the complete Excel.</p>
<p>[37:35] So I manually um sort of whatever hide this Excel</p>
<p>[37:41] uh like that and then I went through every single thing and I did that so Hall of Excellence is this one performance center is this</p>
<p>[37:52] And so on player is player.</p>
<p>[37:55] Teams door</p>
<p>[37:57] is uh team store</p>
<p>[38:00] um atrium there&#39;s another screen here that has no specification on specification page I don&#39;t know for which reason but I just copied exactly how Excel was and put that screen here and then it has two options for warranty which I just copied one by one</p>
<p>[38:21] Uh actually one is warranty and one is annual check.</p>
<p>[38:27] Uh</p>
<p>[38:29] To summarise</p>
<p>[38:31] Again.</p>
<p>[38:33] This is the it L the LED course sheet this is margin analysis exactly what it is on LED sheet</p>
<p>[38:41] needs to be in specification section</p>
<p>[38:45] Exactly what it is on margin analysis needs to be on my on the pricing um subsection of the PDF.</p>
<p>[38:54] That is what we&#39;re trying to to work towards. Okay, uh just to confirm that the let&#39;s let&#39;s agree on the terms, let&#39;s call it the the cost analysis. This is the Excel that you would put on the software. The software uh basically gives you the PDF. Now the just to confirm the cost analysis sheet is always going to be in the same format and the same you know columns is uh uh and so on, like always going to be the same or will it s will will it sometimes be different uh different picture.</p>
<p>[39:29] But for now, this is our format. Always look the same couple. Always always always the same stuff. So LED sheet always look like this. Margin analysis always look like this. But there&#39;s various number of lines.</p>
<p>[39:44] And you see here this tax is not calculated and bead bond is not calculated. So this number matches this one number exactly. In some cases we will have taxes and bead bond. In some cases gonna be tax and permit. So these are variables as well.</p>
<p>[40:03] But it always gonna be like this. We&#39;ll never show cost to our client. Cost is how much it costs us. We never show margin number to our client, we&#39;ll never show margin percentage to our client. So the only thing client sees is this name and the selling price.</p>
<p>[40:22] Okay. I&#39;m Okay, perfect.</p>
<p>[40:24] Um great Natalia. So w just so because uh you know this project has like many or it&#39;s not it it it it it it it it it it it has many steps let&#39;s say but for now what I would focus on is this is the this call right now is to give it an exercise it gives you um a PDF. Uh to simplify basically. Is that correct?</p>
<p>[40:48] Yes, absolutely. What you and I are working on</p>
<p>[40:51] It&#39;s just that whatever Excel looks like you generate a PDF and if uh estimator puts some stupid number on top if this is gonna be exactly the way he hits his PDF with some stupid name on top. So they need to learn how to properly know name their sheets, not like idiotic names. Then if they wanna not to see any alternative, they need to hide that themselves. They have to also do some work. Your job is to build the engine that takes whatever Excel looks like and makes one to one PDF that looks exactly like that. I got it. No whatever. So for the for and there&#39;s no calculation needed. If the number is like that here, this is the number we want to see. There&#39;s no uh in this particular piece of the puzzle there&#39;s no calculations involved. Okay, okay, perfect. Okay, great. So that&#39;s perfect. So I will send you as many examples of this as you want uh of all the proposals that I&#39;ve worked like in the last couple of uh weeks, months, whatever. So you can see</p>
<p>[41:58] Yes. And uh then um</p>
<p>[42:01] Can you go back to your like engine thing you were just showing me? Yeah.</p>
<p>[42:06] Thank you.</p>
<p>[42:13] Okay, back to the other stuff showing.</p>
<p>[42:16] Yeah.</p>
<p>[42:24] Uh can you Where&#39;s my teeth? Where are my teeth?</p>
<p>[42:27] Yeah, I need to I need to find us. Stop sharing. Okay.</p>
<p>[42:32] No, I cannot speak yet.</p>
<p>[42:56] Can you see?</p>
<p>[43:04] Yeah, no I can see it. So the provo the the uh the the the the the the the the the the PDF that I&#39;m seeing on the right hand side it says like invoice date date you you can kill all of that right? Yeah yeah yeah like I said that&#39;s just uh it&#39;s whatever it&#39;s not not not not not the real deal</p>
<p>[43:21] Okay, good. Just want to make sure it&#39;s this looks like a very like sterile invoice. You want it to be more like hey clients take a look at the things. So I will send you some uh PDFs that I have been working on and uh I&#39;m talking to my marketing girl. Um her name is Alison. She may join like one of the final polls for once the software is built to kind of review the um</p>
<p>[43:49] the guidelines but I send you this PDF you will see it in our Slack it has our brand colours and um</p>
<p>[43:58] logos and all the uh trademarks and all the things to that are approved by fans</p>
<p>[44:04] how to use uh the colour scheme and things like this. Okay, I I I will take a look. Uh</p>
<p>[44:11] Yes, I will put everything together after the score. Uh and</p>
<p>[44:17] I feel just called I will I will put everything together and uh just uh s send you something to confirm the plan so I can I can work on this where you give it.</p>
<p>[44:26] An action it gives you the uh exact same PDF that you&#39;re at.</p>
<p>[44:34] That&#39;s perfect. So let me send you like five, six examples of Excel so you can just see what it is and wrap your head around. Again, you don&#39;t worry about calculations how those numbers appear. S somehow it&#39;s it&#39;s just like already like final piece, whatever. We&#39;re not calculating anything for this part and then tomorrow</p>
<p>[44:56] Um once you meet the destinators they will kinda talk you through the calculations of things like this and how they want to use the um software and like uh what they wanna do with that and what kind of budget they&#39;re gonna be calculating and things like that. So zero expectations for you to talk or to besides like introducing yourself and to share anything that is ready. The only thing that we will kind of remember uh when you send me that demo where we played, uh my boss was trying to open it and to send somebody else and then the person says oh the demo is no longer working. Ah yeah, yeah. Uh I can I can I can that on. Can you resurrect it for tomorrow call and she because we have another guy who is like a head of product, he wants to join tomorrow&#39;s call. So if you join I will say like now Ahmad kind of like give you the little demo</p>
<p>[45:51] Five minutes and then just show them how that demo worked because that&#39;s what he wanted to see. And then after the call you can like drop the uh the the link again. We don&#39;t we&#39;re not gonna be needing it anymore. Okay, good then. Yeah, and again nothing should be ready for tomorrow, don&#39;t worry about it. You don&#39;t need to spend time understanding any logics or any calculations because they will uh literally be talking to you about it tomorrow how everything how they do it. So yeah. Okay. But but Natalia uh for the overall project w which which which which which which which which which which way or which approach did you like that bet better? The first demo I showed you where it&#39;s uh you know all AI talking to you and so on. Or some or this. Or do you want to combine the two in a way?</p>
<p>[46:42] Well I I I think you need to talk to both Astimator and myself and see which software works better. And I trust as an expert to think that to pick that software. Don&#39;t ask like don&#39;t give people too much options because they will start going crazy. It&#39;s whatever software you recommend we will use. I um for me you have to think about it like I don&#39;t know anything about AI. So whatever you teach me how to use, I will use. Like let&#39;s say I learned in Design and Photoshop and I&#39;m super like comfortable with that because this is the only design software I know. So if I know open something new, I&#39;ll be like oh sh I don&#39;t know anything, but I&#39;ll just have to learn. Same here everything as long as everything is like clean and straightforward, it&#39;s we&#39;re gonna just</p>
<p>[47:32] Use that um I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I&#39;m preparing for like the the the work is super busy and I&#39;m I I&#39;m running I have a key to make things even more fun. I&#39;m also training for like a marathon. Wow so very um you know busy if you are okay. Um kidding, no kidding. Well thank you so much for this call I know it&#39;s gonna be where you are. Uh look forward to talking to you tomorrow if in the meantime you start like looking and I will send you some exams and PDFs. And if you start looking at something you have more questions than just uh slap me. Absolutely, thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>[48:19] No problem. Thank you.</p>
