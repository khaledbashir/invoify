1.03 DEFINITIONS A. Activity: A discrete part of a project that can be identified for planning, scheduling, monitoring,
and controlling the construction project. Activities included in a construction schedule consume time and resources. 1. Critical Activity: Tasks with no (zero) total float time which determine the critical path and
control project completion. 2. Critical activities are activities on the critical path. They must start and finish on the
planned early start and finish times. 3. Predecessor Activity: An activity that precedes another activity in the network. 4. Successor Activity: An activity that follows another activity in the network.
B. Cost Loading: The allocation of the schedule of values for the completion of an activity as scheduled. The sum of costs for all activities must equal the total Contract Sum, unless otherwise approved by the Architect.
C. Critical Path Method (CPM): A construction scheduling technique using network analysis diagrams to plan and organize construction activities in an orderly manner along the critical path.
D. Critical Path: The longest connected chain of interdependent activities through the network schedule that establishes the minimum overall Project duration and contains no float.
E. Event: The starting or ending point of an activity. F. Float: Time available for a given activity in excess of its estimated duration. It represents the
amount of leeway available in scheduling an activity. 1. Float time is not for the exclusive use of benefit of either University or Contractor, but is a
jointly owned, expiring Project resource available to both parties as needed to meet schedule milestones and Contract completion date.

<li>Updating Schedules a. Updates to the schedule shall be presented by the Contractor and discussed at
periodic progress meetings or as designated by the University. Update any significant changes as a result of action agreed to in the periodic progress meeting.
b. The Contractor acknowledges that updating the schedule to reflect actual progress made as of the date of update is not a modification to the Contract’s schedule requirements.
c. Submit computer reports and network graphics that reflect the progress of construction with respect to time, in accordance with the requirements of the initial Contractor-proposed Construction Schedule. Adjust the selection and sort sequence, format, and content of reports as directed by University.</li>
<li>University’s Review and Contractor Schedule Revisions a. Re-submittals shall be in the same quantities as for monthly submissions. Upon
acceptance of the initial or updated Construction Schedule by the University, the Contractor shall, within &lt;3 calendar days&gt;: 1) Distribute copies of the accepted Construction Schedule to subcontractors,
suppliers, University, Architect and other concerned parties. 2) Instruct recipients to promptly report in writing, problems anticipated by the

WVU Division 1 - Project Specifications  Project No:  20200523
013200 - 5 | P a g e
the University&#39;s summary review of the schedule leads the University to believe that the Contractor has met the general requirements of this Section pertaining to the schedule’s format and content. Acceptance by University of the Construction Schedule does not relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for the accuracy or feasibility of the Contractor&#39;s plan for execution of construction, or to perform the construction within specified time constraints. Such acceptance does not express or imply that the University warrants, acknowledges or admits the reasonableness of the activities, logic, durations, manpower, or equipment requirements of the Contractor&#39;s proposed or accepted schedule.
E. Other Construction Schedule Requirements 1. The Contractor shall come to progress meetings with the required data prepared in
advance of each meeting, to provide, as of the end of the updating period, a complete and accurate report of contract procurement and construction progress and showing how the Contractor plans to continue construction to meet the Contract completion date.</li>
<li>Illustrate complete sequence of construction by activity. Provide dates for submittals including those for University furnished items, if any, and return of submittals, dates for procurement and delivery of products, and dates for installation and provision for testing.</li>
<li>Schedule Status Report: Provide a written report describing the following: a. Status of construction and the schedule. b. Physical progress during the report period. c. Activities modified since previous report period. d. Major changes in construction work. e. Major milestones (achieved and slipped). f. Plans for forthcoming report period. g. Actions to correct any negative float predictions. h. Problem areas. i. Anticipated delays and their impact on schedule. j. Changes required to maintain the Date of Substantial Completion. k. Corrective action taken or proposed. l. The University reserves the right to ask for additional information in this format on a
monthly basis if required to expedite the review and acceptance process. 4. University’s Review and Contractor Schedule Revisions
a. At the request of the University, the Contractor shall participate in any meetings necessary to reach a mutual agreement and acceptance of schedule and other reports.
b. The University will respond in writing within &lt;14 calendar days&gt; to each submitted schedule update. The University&#39;s response may include questions and/or requests for revisions. Within &lt;14 calendar days&gt; of receipt of the University’s response, the Contractor shall respond by submitting a revised schedule if he accepts the University’s revision requests, or the Contractor shall submit in writing his justification why such revisions should not be implemented. If the Contractor&#39;s justification for not implementing the revisions is acceptable to the University, the University will accept the Contractor’s schedule as submitted. Schedule issues that remain unresolved will result in a schedule that is not accepted by the University. The University’s non-acceptance of the Contractor’s schedule does not absolve the Contractor of the requirement to meet the completion date required by the Contract.
c. The University&#39;s acceptance of a schedule submitted by the Contractor in no way makes the University insurers of success of the Contractor&#39;s time performance, or liable for time or cost overruns flowing from the shortcomings of a Contractor-authored schedule. The University disclaims and the Contractor waives any University obligation or liability by reason of the University&#39;s acceptance of the Contractor&#39;s schedule submissions.</li>
<li>Float Time a. Float is not for the exclusive benefit of either the Contractor or University. The
Contractor shall manage construction according to early start dates, by commencing
WVU Division 1 - Project Specifications  Project No:  20200523
013200 - 6 | P a g e
activities on the early start date (calculated by the latest accepted schedule) or earlier if possible, unless constrained by a bona fide resource limitation. Actual or projected University-caused delays that do not exceed available float time shall not have any effect on the Contractor&#39;s adherence to specified time constraints and shall not be a basis for any time extension.
b. The Contractor acknowledges the following: 1) Activity delays shall not automatically result in adjustment of specified time
constraints. 2) A Contract Modification or other University action or inaction may not affect
existing critical activities or cause non-critical activities to become critical. 3) A Contract Modification or delay may result in only absorbing a part of the
available total float that may exist within an activity chain of the network, thereby not causing any effect on specified time constraints.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Pursuant to the above float sharing requirements, use of float released by elimination of float suppression techniques such as preferential sequencing, special lead/lag logic restraints, unreasonably extended activity durations, or imposed dates shall be distributed by the University to the benefit of the University and Contractor.
c. If the Contractor wishes to complete construction earlier than the time required, the following shall apply: 1) The Contractor shall continue to calculate float based on the construction
completion date required by the Contract and Contract Modifications, by maintaining the required Substantial Completion date as a &#34;finish-no-later-than&#34; constraint.</li>
<li>The completion time for construction shall not be amended by the University&#39;s acceptance of the Contractor&#39;s proposed earlier completion date.</li>
<li>The Contractor shall not, under any circumstances, receive additional compensation for fees, General Conditions, or Trade Contracts for the period between the time of earlier completion proposed by Contractor and the completion time for construction specified as of NTP.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Weather Caused Delays a. The Contractor’s request for weather caused time extensions during a given month
shall be considered only for actual work days lost in excess of the number of work days listed in the table above and meeting the above criteria. The Contractor shall meet the submission and notification requirements and follow the procedures for requesting time adjustments to the schedule as described in this Section.</li>
<li>Contract Modifications, Delays, and Time Extensions a. Submit a written Time Impact Analysis with proposed contract modifications which
affect the Contract’s required completion date, illustrating the impact of the proposed contract modification on that date.
b. Time Impact Analyses shall include a Fragnet (network analysis) demonstrating how the Contractor proposes to incorporate the proposed contract modification or delay into the Construction Schedule. The analysis shall demonstrate the time impact based on the date the signed Contract Modification is given to the Contractor, the status of construction at that point in time, and the event time computation of all affected activities. The event times used in the analysis shall be those included in the latest update of the schedule or as adjusted by mutual agreement. The Contractor shall submit any supporting electronic files with the Time Impact Analysis.
c. Time extensions will be granted only to the extent that the equitable time adjustment for the activities affected exceeds the total float along the path of activities at the time of actual delay or at the time that Notice to Proceed was issued for the Contract Modification. Each Time Impact Analysis shall be submitted in triplicate within &lt;14 calendar days&gt; after a delay occurs or after notice of direction for a change is given to the Contractor by the University. If the Contractor does not submit a Time Impact Analysis with a proposed contract modification for a delay within the required time
WVU Division 1 - Project Specifications  Project No:  20200523
013200 - 7 | P a g e
period, he shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived his rights to any additional time and cost. Upon mutual agreement by both parties, Fragnets illustrating the influence of Contract Modifications and delays will be incorporated into the schedule during the first update after agreement is reached.
d. In the event the Contractor does not agree with the decision of the University regarding the impact of a delay, it shall be resolved in accordance with the General Conditions.</li>
<li>Responsibility for Completion a. The Contractor shall furnish sufficient field personnel, offices, materials, facilities,
plant and equipment, to ensure the prosecution of construction in accordance with the current accepted schedule. If the University advises that the Contractor has fallen behind in meeting milestones as presented in the schedule, the Contractor shall take such steps as may be necessary to improve progress. Upon the University&#39;s written notice that the Contractor is behind schedule as a result of inexcusable causes, the Contractor shall immediately mitigate such loss by increasing the hours of work, the number of shifts, overtime operations and/or the amount of construction equipment without additional cost to the University. The Contractor acknowledges that such remedial action on his part is not compensable acceleration of the performance of construction.
b. Work for remedial action may be conducted on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays, with sufficient written notice and subject to the University’s approval.
F. Contractor’s Responsibility for the Schedule 1. Should the Contractor fail to define any element of construction, activity, or logic, and
University review does not detect this omission or error, such omission or error, when discovered by the Contractor or University, shall be corrected by the Contractor before the next monthly schedule update and shall not be cause for delay of completion of construction within the required time. The Contractor acknowledges that the University is not required or otherwise obligated to discover errors or omissions in the Contractor&#39;s proposed schedule. The University&#39;s acceptance of a schedule does not relieve the Contractor of his responsibility for the schedule.
