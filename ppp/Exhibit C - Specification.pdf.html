will occur over 8 hour days. It is more likely that training will be scheduled in 4 to 6 hour increments; perhaps over a period of weeks (or even months).
D.  The following is a general idea of the training “curriculum”:
A general familiarization of the Owner’s Representative of the device.  An explanation of how the device interfaces to the rest of the system (including data
connections; timing requirements and the like).  General training on operating the device.  Specific training on device operation (e.g. entering statistics; how to access data retrieval
sources; how to create repeatable formats and layouts, changing fonts, loading new fonts).
Saving information; backing information up (including a review of the proper procedures for backing up.
Basic troubleshooting  Specific troubleshooting (this information may be conveyed to personnel other than the
device’s “operators”).  How to upgrade software; precautions taken while doing (e.g. backing-up existing
software, don’t be the first one to try the new software on game day).
E.  Any time spent troubleshooting shall not count towards fulfilling this requirement and shall be extended an equal amount of time.

E.  Verify all locations of equipment in all rooms with Owner’s Representative, Owner, and Consultant.
F.  Outdoor mounted junction boxes to meet NEMA 3 or better.
3.2  INSTALLATION
A.  Installation of cable and wiring
Cabling and Wiring:
Install cable in a manner to adhere to manufacturer’s specifications for maximum cable pulling tension, minimum bend radius, and restrictions.
Provide appropriate support at all horizontal-to-vertical transitions in order to keep the weight of the cable from degrading at the point of transition.
If a J-hook or trapeze system is used to support cable bundles, all horizontal cables shall be supported at a maximum of 48-inch (1.2 meter) intervals.  At no point shall the cables rest on light fixtures, acoustic ceiling grids, panels, conduits, sprinkler pipe, water pipe and/or HVAC system ducting.
Horizontal distribution cables shall be bundled in groups of no more than 50 cables when being supported by J-Hook or trapeze systems. Cable bundle quantities in excess of 50 cables may cause deformation of the bottom cables within the bundle and degrade cable performance. An exception to this rule is when cable is installed in cable tray systems.
Cable shall be installed above fire-sprinkler systems and shall not be attached to the system or any ancillary equipment or hardware. The cable system and support hardware shall be installed so that it does not obscure any valves, fire alarm conduit, boxes, or other control devices
Cables shall not be attached to ceiling grid or lighting fixture wires. Where support for horizontal cable is required, install appropriate carriers to support the cabling.
Any cable damaged or exceeding recommended installation parameters during installation shall be replaced prior to final acceptance at no cost to the Owner.
Cables shall be identified by a self-adhesive machine label in accordance with the System Documentation Section of this specification and ANSI/TIA/EIA-606-A. The cable label shall
WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY
WJHW STADIUM DECEMBER 18, 2019
be applied to the cable behind the faceplate on a section of cable that can be accessed by removing the cover plate.
Unshielded twisted pair cable shall be installed so that there are no bends smaller than four times the cable outside diameter at any point in the run and at the termination field.
Provide splice free wiring and cabling from origination to destination.  Cables shall be installed in continuous lengths from origin to destination (no splices).  Properly designed transition points, or consolidation points are not considered ‘splice’ points.
Make joints and connections with rosin-core 60/40 solder or with mechanical connectors specifically intended for the type and class of cable being used.  Where spade lugs are used, crimp properly with ratchet type tool.
Take precaution to prevent and guard against electromagnetic and electrostatic hum. For line-level audio signal, float cable shield at one end. Shield not connected to be folded back over cable jacket and covered with heat-shrink tubing. Do not cut off unused shield.
Isolate cables and wires of different signals or different levels; and separate, organize, and route to restrict channel crosstalk or feedback oscillation in any amplifier section. Keep wiring separated into groups for microphone level circuits, line level circuits, loudspeaker circuits, and power circuits.
Connect cable to active components through XLR connections whenever multiple formats are available. Make connections to speaker transformers with properly sized closed end connectors crimped with factory approved ratchet type tool. Wire nut or &#34;Scotchlock&#34; connectors are not acceptable. Do not wrap audio cable splices or connections with adhesive backed tape.
Cover edges of cable and wire pass-through holes in chassis, housings, boxes, etc., with rubber grommets or Brady GRNY nylon grommets.
Execute wiring in strict adherence to:  Phillip Giddings. Audio System Design and Installation. Indianapolis: Howard W.
Sams &amp; Co., 1990.   Don Davis and Carolyn Davis. Appendix II, Recommended Wiring Practices.
Sound System Engineering, 2nd Edition. Indianapolis: Howard W. Sams &amp; Co., 1989.  AV Installation Handbook Second Edition: The Best Practices for Quality
Audiovisual Systems, Infocomm, 2015
Equipment Housing Cabling and Wiring:  Lace, tie, or harness wire or cable as required herein, and in accordance with
accepted professional practice.  Dress, lace or harness all wire or cable to prevent mechanical stress on electrical connections; no wire or cable shall be supported by a connection point.  Install cable and wire neatly tied in manageable bundles with cable lengths cut to minimize excess cable slack but still allow for service and testing. Provide horizontal support bars if cable bundles sag. Reference photos below for standard of quality.

E.  Audio Signal Paths
Verify operation from each source device through all switching, amplification and distribution devices.
F.  System Gain Adjustment
Adjust each active device to have proper gain structure from the mixer output to the input of the amplifier.
With all amplifiers turned off, connect a sine wave or pink noise generator to the input of the mixer. Using a RMS AC voltmeter with a dB scale, adjust the mixer to an output between -10 and 0 dBu. Once the level has been established, it should remain unchanged throughout the test. All equalizers should be set flat for this test.
Follow the signal flow from the mixer to each subsequent component. Measure the input level and output level of each device at the point of connection to the device. The input level reading should differ no more than 0.25 dB from the level recorded for the preceding device. Diagnose and correct the wiring or equipment when any readings exceed this range.
Adjust the output of each component to achieve the proper output level.
Record the output levels of each device in the Project Record Manual.
G.  Signal Delay Adjustment
Adjust the delay to each subsystem to ensure proper synchronization between the main speakers and delayed speakers.
Using a industry standard two-channel FFT measurement system such as Smaart or EASERA Systune, measure the arrival time of the distant signal and then measure the arrival of the local signal.
Based on the arrival times measured, adjust the delay applied to the local speakers to synchronize them with the distant speakers. Repeat the test to verify the delay has been set to within 1ms of the arrival of the distant signal. Once the precise delay time has been determined, provide an additional 10ms of Haas effect delay to maintain directional orientation toward the original sound source.
Continue to test and adjust each separate subsystem with a dedicated delay channel.
Provide hard-copy printout of each delay adjustment showing first the arrival times with no delay set and then the result after the delay has been adjusted. Record the settings of each delay in the Project Record Manual.
H.  Remote Input Verification Test

3.2  INSTALLATION
A.  Installation of cable and wiring
Cabling and Wiring:  Install cable in a manner to adhere to manufacturer’s specifications for maximum
cable pulling tension, minimum bend radius, and any other restrictions.  Provide appropriate support at all horizontal-to-vertical transitions in order to keep
the weight of the cable from degrading at the point of transition.    If a J-hook or trapeze system is used to support cable bundles, all horizontal
cables shall be supported at a maximum of 48-inch (1.2 meter) intervals.  At no point shall the cables rest on light fixtures, acoustic ceiling grids, panels, conduits, sprinkler pipe, water pipe and/or HVAC system ducting.
Horizontal distribution cables shall be bundled in groups of no more than 50 cables when being supported by J-Hook or trapeze systems. Cable bundle quantities in excess of 50 cables may cause deformation of the bottom cables within the bundle and degrade cable performance. An exception to this rule is when cable is installed in cable tray systems.
Cable shall be installed above fire-sprinkler systems and shall not be attached to the system or any ancillary equipment or hardware. The cable system and support hardware shall be installed so that it does not obscure any valves, fire alarm conduit, boxes, or other control devices.
Cables shall not be attached to ceiling grid or lighting fixture wires. Where support for horizontal cable is required, install appropriate carriers to support the cabling.
Any cable damaged or exceeding recommended installation parameters during installation shall be replaced prior to final acceptance at no cost to the Owner.
Cables shall be identified by a self-adhesive machine label in accordance with the System Documentation Section of this specification and ANSI/TIA/EIA-606-A. The cable label shall be applied to the cable behind the faceplate on a section of cable that can be accessed by removing the cover plate.

A.  Transport Control
Provide standard Stop, Play, Pause, Fast Forward, and Rewind for each playback device and menu control for DVD players. Buttons should be arranged in a conventional fashion that will be familiar to the normal user.
The selected control function should be displayed by showing the appropriate button “pressed”. It should remain this way until another function is selected.
For devices that will go into a standby mode after a period of time, the control system shall sense this mode and restore normal operating mode once a transport function has been selected. This may require the use of current sensors to determine the state of the unit. No direct user action should be required at the playback device to restore the normal operating mode.
B.  Screen/Shade Control
In addition to up-down functions, provide a Stop function to allow the movement to be halted. Once movement has been stopped, the up or down buttons should resume travel in the selected direction.
Control system shall not prevent <a class="g3mark-shortlink" href="https://screen.corp.google.com/shade">screen/shade</a> wall controls from being used as well.  Touch panel controls should be readily accessible to the user to permit direct control of
shades or screen with having to navigate through multiple control pages.
C.  Room Combining
Combining of adjacent areas shall be done through a graphical representation of the physical areas to be combined. Use of a floor plan metaphor is recommended with the graphic oriented correctly with respect to control panel location.
Use buttons or other appropriate objects placed along the common wall to enable the combining function.
When spaces are combined, the graphic appearance of those areas shall change to reflect this configuration. Once an area is separated from a combination, the color of its area should revert to the normal room color.
WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY
WJHW COLISEUM DECEMBER 18, 2019

VOL ON/OFF buttons shall change color to indicate the status of the button.
F.  Standard Colors
Control functions shall be color coded to add clarity and show relationships between different groups of controls.
The color Red shall be reserved to indicate a fault or abnormal condition.   Green may be used to indicate normal operation, but may be used for standard control
colors as well.  Similar controls should maintain the same color scheme across all control pages.  When a function is selected, the graphical depiction of that button should appear to be
pressed and its color change to a darker shade of the regular button color.  Color schemes used for background and foreground objects should be selected to be
complimentary and provide a consistent theme throughout the control pages.
G.  Minimum Button Size and Placement
Minimum visual size of a button is 3/8” wide by 1/4” high.   Spacing between buttons should be no less than 1/16”.  Where buttons are immediately adjacent, the active selection area of the button should
be reduced to 80% of the visual area of the button.
H.  Button Actions
When a function on a control page is selected, that button or visual object associated with that function should change to reflect what has been chosen.
For functions that are momentary selections (i.e. VOL UP), the change of state is visible for as long as the button is being pressed.
For function that are maintained selections (i.e. PLAY), the change of state remains visible until another function is selected and resets the previous function..
The state change of a button or visible object should depict real-world objects as much as possible including the appearance of the button be pressed inward, change in shade of the original color, but not a change in hue.
I.  Labels
WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY
WJHW COLISEUM DECEMBER 18, 2019
Use of simple words or titles are preferred to indicate functionality, navigation and system status.
Use of stylish symbols should be avoided unless their identity is commonly recognized by the general public. Standard symbols for transport functions are acceptable.
Labels should be presented in a clear, sans serif type face that will remain legible on lower resolution touch panels.
Where physical buttons are present along the side of a touch panel, these buttons should be engraved and filled with a contrasting color.
J.  Power On/Off
For panels requiring an ON/OFF control, these functions should be linked through current sensors or other methods for the control system to detect the power on condition of the component being controlled.
Powering off a system should not interfere with the ability of a projector to complete its cool down cycle.
K.  Look &amp; Feel
Control pages should utilize a clean, elegant but stylish appearance.  Use a common graphical template across all control pages for a consistent look.  The touch screen layout should utilize graphical elements such as drop shadows,
gradient fills and transparency to provide a pleasing overall appearance.  Utilize graphical representations of floor plans to convey location information.  Include company logos, icons or watermarks to portray the corporate identity.  Provide clear navigation tools for moving between control pages.  Each sub-page should have a “BACK” button to return to the previous page. This button
should appear in the same location on each page.  Provide a “HELP” button or icon on each user page to provide clear, non-technical
instructions on how to use the functions available to regular users.
L.  Security
Provide password access to control pages not intended to be accessed by the general public.
Unless otherwise noted, provide a minimum of three levels of access  General User  Non-Technical Employee  AV Technician

3.7  COMMISSIONING
A.  Prior to energizing or testing the system, ensure the following:
All products are installed in proper and safe manner according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Insulation and heat shrink tubing are present where required.  Dust, debris, solder splatter, etc. is removed.  Cable is dressed, routed, and labeled; connections are consistent with regard to polarity.  Labeling has been provided.  Temporary facilities and utilities have been properly disconnected, removed and
disposed of off-site.  Products are neat, clean, and unmarred. Parts securely attached.  Broken work, including glass, raised flooring and supports, ceiling tiles and supports,
walls, doors, etc. have been replaced or properly repaired. All debris has been cleaned up and discarded.
B.  Prior to energizing the System, verify and perform the following tests and adjustments in compliance with applicable EIA standards.
Electronic devices are properly grounded.  Test each AC power receptacle with a circuit checker for proper hot, neutral, and ground
connections.  Verify each individual component is operating properly.  Verify each individual component’s performance meets the manufacturer’s published
performance for this unit.  Measure and record the DC resistance between the technical ground in any equipment
rack or console and the main building ground. Resistance should be 0.15 ohms or less.
C.  Loudspeaker Circuit Verification Test
Measure the impedance of each loudspeaker line leaving the equipment racks.
WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY
WJHW COLISEUM DECEMBER 18, 2019
For constant voltage systems measure the impedance at 100 (or 250) Hz, 1 KHz and 8 (or 10) KHz of each line leaving the equipment rack with the line disconnected from the driving source.  For band limited devices, use a frequency appropriate for the operating range of the transducer.
When documenting the results of these tests, include the calculated impedance based on number of units on a line and the size and distance of the run. Correct any field readings that differ more than 20% from the calculated impedance.
Include the results of the tests in the Project Record Manual.
D.  Loudspeaker Polarity Verification Test
Use an electronic polarity checker, TEF 20, SYSID, SysTune, SMAART, or other two-channel FFT measurement system to test each loudspeaker. All loudspeakers should have the same relative polarity.
Follow manufacturer’s recommendations in conducting the tests.  Include the results of the tests in the Project Record Manual.
E.  Audio Signal Paths

F.  System Gain Adjustment
Adjust each active device to have proper gain structure from the mixer output to the input of the amplifier.
With all amplifiers turned off, connect a sine wave or pink noise generator to the input of the mixer. Using a RMS AC voltmeter with a dB scale, adjust the mixer to an output between -10 and 0 dBu. Once the level has been established, it should remain unchanged throughout the test. All equalizers should be set flat for this test.
Follow the signal flow from the mixer to each subsequent component. Measure the input level and output level of each device at the point of connection to the device. The input level reading should differ no more than 0.25 dB from the level recorded for the preceding device. Diagnose and correct the wiring or equipment when any readings exceed this range.
Adjust the output of each component to achieve the proper output level.   Record the output levels of each device in the Project Record Manual.
G.  Signal Delay Adjustment
Adjust the delay to each subsystem to ensure proper synchronization between the main speakers and delayed speakers.
Using a TEF 20, SYSID, SysTune, SMAART, or other two-channel FFT measurement system, measure the arrival time of the distant signal and then measure the arrival of the local signal.
Based on the arrival times measured, adjust the delay applied to the local speakers to synchronize them with the distant speakers. Repeat the test to verify the delay has been set to within 1 ms of the arrival of the distant signal. Once the precise delay time has been determined, provide an additional 10 ms of Haas effect delay to maintain directional orientation toward the original sound source.
Continue to test and adjust each separate subsystem with a dedicated delay channel.  Provide hard-copy printout of each delay adjustment showing first the arrival times with
no delay set and then the result after the delay has been adjusted. Record the settings of each delay in the Project Record Manual.
H.  Remote Input Verification Test
Using a microphone or portable signal generator, connect to each microphone/line level receptacle throughout the facility.
WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY
WJHW COLISEUM DECEMBER 18, 2019
Verify that the receptacle under test appears at the correct input and is operating properly.
In a similar manner, check all remote tielines and media related lines for correct wiring and labeling.
I.  System Equalization

3.8  CAT5E/CAT6 CABLE CERTIFICATION
A.  General Field Test Requirements
All CAT5E/CAT6 cabling links installed as part of this scope shall be tested for the following, in accordance with the field test specifications defines in ANSI/TIA-568-C.2 “Commercial Balanced Twisted-Pair Telecommunications Cabling and Components Standard.”  This document will be referred to as the “Category 5e Standard”:
Wire Map  Length  Insertion Loss  NEXT loss  PS NEXT Loss
ACR-F Loss  PS ACR-F Loss  Return Loss
Propagation Loss  Delay Skew
The installed twisted-pair horizontal links shall be tested from terminated end point to terminated end point for compliance with the “Permanent Link” performance specification as defined in the Category 5e Standard.
One hundred percent of the installed cabling links must pass the requirements of the Category 5e standard mentioned above and as further detailed in Section B below. Any failing link must be diagnosed and corrected. The corrective action shall be followed with a new test to prove that the corrected link meets the performance requirements. The final and passing result of the tests for all links shall be provided in the test results documentation in accordance with Section C below.
The test equipment (tester) shall comply with the accuracy requirements for level IIe field testers as defined in ANSI/TIA-1152. The tester including the appropriate interface adapter must meet the specified accuracy requirements. The accuracy requirements for the permanent link test configuration (baseline accuracy plus adapter contribution) are specified in Table 2 of ANSI/TIA-1152 (Table 2 in this TIA document also specifies the accuracy requirements for the channel configuration).
The RJ45 test plug shall fall within the values specified in ANSI/TIA-568-C Annex C for NEXT, FEXT and Return Loss.
The tester shall be within the calibration period recommended by the vendor in order to achieve the vendor-specified measurement accuracy.
The tester interface adapters must be of high quality and the cable shall not show any twisting or kinking resulting from coiling and storing of the tester interface adapters. In order to deliver optimum accuracy, preference is given to a permanent link interface adapter for the tester that can be calibrated to extend the reference plane of the Return Loss measurement to the permanent link interface. To ensure that normal handling on
WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY
WJHW COLISEUM DECEMBER 18, 2019
the job does not cause measurable Return Loss change, the adapter cord cable shall not be of twisted-pair construction.
The Pass or Fail condition of the link-under-test is determined by the results of the required individual tests (detailed in Section 4.2.2 of ANSI/TIA-1152). Any Fail result yields a Fail for the link-under-test. In order to achieve an overall Pass condition, the results for each individual test parameter must Pass.
A Pass or Fail result for each parameter is determined by comparing the measured values with the specifies test limits for that parameter.
B.  Performance Test Parameters
The test parameters are defined by the Category 5e Standard. The test of each link shall contain all of the following parameters as detailed below. In order to pass the test, all measurements (at each frequency in the range from 1 MHz through 100 MHz) must meet or exceed the limit value determined in the above mentioned standard.
Wire Map - Shall report Pass if the wiring of each wire-pair from end to end is determined to be correct.
Length – The field tester shall be capable of measuring length of all pairs of a basic link or channel based on the propagation delay measurement and the average value for NVP.  The physical length of the link shall be calculated using the pair with the shortest electrical delay. This length figure shall be reported and shall be used for making the Pass/Fail decision. The Pass/Fail criteria are based on the maximum length allowed for the Permanent Link configuration (90 meters – 295 feet) plus 10% to allow for the variation and uncertainty of NVP.
Insertion Loss (Attenuation) – Insertion Loss is a measure of signal loss in the permanent link or channel. The term “Attenuation” has been used to designate “Insertion Loss.”  Insertion Loss shall be tested from 1 MHz through 100 MHz in maximum step size of 1 MHz. It is preferred to measure insertion loss at the same frequency intervals as NEXT loss in order to provide a more accurate calculation of the Attenuation-to-Crosstalk Ratio (ACR) parameter. Minimum test results documentation (summary results): Identify the worst wire pair (1 of 4 possible). The test results of the worst wire pair must show the highest attenuation value measured (worst case), the frequency at which the worst case value occurs, and the test limit value at this frequency.
NEXT Loss – Pair-to-pair near end crosstalk loss (abbreviated as NEXT loss) shall be tested for each wire pair combination from each end of the link  (a total of 12 pair combinations).This parameter is to be measured from 1 through 100 MHz. NEXT Loss measures the crosstalk disturbance on a wire pair at the end from which the disturbance signal is transmitted (near-end) on the disturbing pair. The maximum step size for NEXT loss measurements shall not exceed the maximum step size defined in the Category 5e Standard as shown in Table 1. Minimum test results documentation (summary results): Identify the wire pair combination that exhibits the worst value of NEXT (worst case). NEXT is to be measured from each end of the link-under-test. These wire pair combinations must be identified for the tests performed from each end. Each reported case should include the frequency at which it occurs as well as the test limit value at this frequency.

MHz and the step size may not exceed the maximum step size defined in the Category 5e Standard as shown in Table 1. Maximum test results documentation (summary results): Identify the wire pair that exhibits the worst-case  margin and the wire pair that exhibits the worst value for PS next. These wire pairs must be identified for the tests performed from each end. Each reported case should include the frequency at which it occurs as well as the test limit value at this frequency.
ACR-F Loss, pair to pair – Attenuation Crosstalk Ratio Far-end is calculated from the pair-to-pair FEXT Loss. It shall be measured for each wire-pair combination from both ends of the link under-test. FEXT Loss measures the crosstalk disturbance on a wire pair at the opposite end (far-end) from which the transmitter emits the disturbing signal on the disturbing pair. FEXT is measured to compute ACR-F Loss that must be evaluated and reported in the test results. ACR-F measures the relative strength of the far-end crosstalk disturbance relative to the attenuated signal that arrives at the end of the link.  This test yields 24 wire pair combinations. ACR-F is to be measured 1 through 100 MHz and the maximum step size for FEXT loss measurements shall not exceed the maximum step size defined as the standard as in Table 1. Minimum test results documentation (summary results): Identify the wire pair combination that exhibits the worst value for ACR-F. There wire pairs must be identified for the tests performed from each end. Each reported case should include the frequency at which it occurs as well as the test limit value at this frequency.
PS ACR-F Loss – Power Sum Attenuation Crosstalk Ratio Far-end is a calculated parameter that combines the effect of the FEXT disturbance from three wire pairs of the fourth one. This test yields eight wire-pair combinations. Each wire-pair is evaluated from 1 through 100 MHz in frequency increments that do not exceed the maximum step size defined in the standard as shown in Table 1. Minimum test results documentation (summary results): Identify the wire pair that exhibits the worst pair combinations must be identified for the tests performed from each end. Each reported case should include the frequency at which it occurs as well as the test limit value at this frequency.
Return Loss – Return Loss (RL) measures the total energy reflected on each wire pair. Return Loss is to be measured from both ends of the link-under-test for each wire pair. This parameter is also to be measured from 1 through 100 MHz in frequency increments that do not exceed the maximum step size defined in the Category 5e Standard as shown in Table 1. Minimum test results documentation (summary results): Identify the wire pair that exhibits the worst value of Return Loss. These wire pairs must be identified for the tests performed from each end. Each reported case should include the frequency at which it occurs as well as the test limit value at this frequency.
Propagation Delay – Propagation delay is the time required for the signal to travel from one of the links to the other. This measurement is to be performed for each of the four wire pairs. Minimum test results documentation (summary results): Identify the wire pair with the worst propagation delay. The report shall include the propagation delay value measured as well as the test limit value.
Delay Skew – [as defined in the Category 5e Standard; Section 6.2.19] This parameter shows the difference in propagation delay between the four wire pairs. The pair with the shortest propagation delay between the four wire pairs. The pair with the shortest propagation delay is the reference pair with a delay skew value of zero. Minimum test results documentation (summary results): Identify the wire pair with the worst-case propagation delay (the longest propagation delay). The report shall include the delay skew value measured as well as the test limit value.
C.  Test Result Documentation
The test results/measurements shall be transferred into a Windows based database utility that allows for the maintenance, inspection, and archiving of these test records. A guarantee must be made that the measurement results are transferred to the PC unaltered, i.e., “as saved in the tester” at the end of each test and that these results cannot be modified at a later time.
