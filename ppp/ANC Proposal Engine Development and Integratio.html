<p>Hi Natalia</p>
<p>Natalia Kovaleva  [4:51 PM]</p>
<p>Good Morning!</p>
<p>[4:52 PM]Ok we are finally doing it.</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [4:52 PM]</p>
<p>Good morning  thanks for having me here, Yes! very excited</p>
<p>Natalia Kovaleva  [4:55 PM]</p>
<p>I will send you some things to look over now:</p>
<p>Excel Spreadsheet Cost sheet - budget formula calculations.xlsxExcel Spreadsheet[4:55 PM]first of all, what is the time where you are at, and what are hours you are working?</p>
<p>[4:57 PM]so like we talked about, in many cases we will wont the program to do 2 things for us : 1) calculate everythung 2) turn into nice PDF.</p>
<p>[4:57 PM]However, in some cases we will feed the program already calculated file and will just need the nice PDF. lets start there</p>
<p>[4:58 PM]attached is the excel that i would consider a perfect example of that. Million screens that i retyped on friday</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [4:58 PM]</p>
<p>right now its 5pm and i can adapt to whatever time works for you for  daily weekly chats etc no issues</p>
<p>Natalia Kovaleva  [4:59 PM]</p>
<p>ok. i have a call in 30 min thats will run all the way till 1 pm est so will be late your time. If you want to start working on somethng tiday i can walk you through this excel</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [5:01 PM]</p>
<p>okay let me have  until tomorrow to understand the excel and i will then get back to  you with  with a few suggestions to see which approach you would prefer along with any questions i have</p>
<p>[5:01 PM]will that work for you</p>
<p>Natalia Kovaleva  [5:02 PM]</p>
<p>ok - this is not our most typical excel as it does not have tabs for install.</p>
<p>[5:04 PM]the logic you will need to get from it is that every screen from page LED COST SHEET whould have to be presented with first specs then pricing.</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [5:04 PM]</p>
<p>i see install  but if this is not it  yes  please  share with me anything you can  so i can  digest everything</p>
<p>image.png Natalia Kovaleva  [5:09 PM]</p>
<p>i think if i sent everything with no background it will be too much, trust me.</p>
<p>this sheet is what you and I can start with - already calculated excel and we just need PDF.</p>
<p>[5:10 PM]lets quickly talk about it. Can i call your Slack?</p>
<p>[5:10 PM]estimators can do deep dive on wed. Will it work?</p>
<p>Natalia Kovaleva  [7:03 PM]</p>
<p>For you and I, do you want to do 8 am-9 am est tomorrow?</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [7:05 PM]</p>
<p>Hi Natalia sorry for the disconnect, yes i can do wed  with the estimators and tomorrow  9 est  is great</p>
<p>Natalia Kovaleva  [7:10 PM]</p>
<p>9-10?</p>
<p>[7:10 PM]Wednesday can you do 10-11?  (edited)</p>
<p>[7:11 PM]Wednesday</p>
<p>[7:11 PM]10-11</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [7:11 PM]</p>
<p>can you send me your logo and any branding youd like to include</p>
<p>[7:12 PM]Wednesday 11 sounds good</p>
<p>Natalia Kovaleva  [7:12 PM]</p>
<p>11-12 or 10-11?</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [7:12 PM]</p>
<p>11-12</p>
<p>Natalia Kovaleva  [7:21 PM]</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [3:26 PM]</p>
<p>Hi Natalia,</p>
<p>Looking forward to our call in 30 minutes! I&#39;ve been diving into the Cost Sheet and have everything mapped out for the Intelligence Core implementation.</p>
<p>To make our time together maximally productive, I need clarity on a few items:</p>
<ol>
<li>PDF Template Requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>I see the ABCDE LOI PDF uses your specific branding (fonts, colors, layout). To build an accurate PDF generator, I&#39;ll need:</p>
<p>Your ANC logo (high-res PNG or SVG preferred)Exact hex codes for your brand colorsFooter text for every proposal (contact info, legal disclaimers, etc.)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Scope of Work Text – Static or Dynamic?</li>
</ol>
<p>The Excel has numerical values, but the PDF includes legal text like &#34;ANC will provide the LED Displays...&#34;</p>
<p>Key question: Is this text standardized (same for every project), or does it vary by context (Union Labor, Indoor vs. Outdoor)?</p>
<p>If it varies: What are the decision rules for which text block applies when?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Excel Export for Finance</li>
</ol>
<p>You mentioned Finance needs to understand &#34;how we arrived at the numbers.&#34; Two options:</p>
<p>Option A: Live formulas in the backup ExcelOption B: A detailed &#34;Values Report&#34; showing each calculation step-by-step</p>
<p>Which works better for your finance team?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Wednesday with Your Estimators</li>
</ol>
<p>Planning the call with them to understand the formula logic. Should I:</p>
<p>Come prepared with specific questions about the &#34;Install&#34; tab formulas?Walk through a real project example together, or discuss formulas in abstract?</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Implementation Priority</li>
</ol>
<p>For this week, which should I prioritize:</p>
<p>Mode A: Upload Excel → Generate perfect PDF (the &#34;copy-paste killer&#34;)Mode B: Smart AI that suggests products and auto-calculates from raw specs</p>
<p>Looking forward to connecting. Let&#39;s dive deep on these.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>To make this as productive as possible, please help me with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>led specs and calculation</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not anticipate us to have time to look into pricing structural, electrical, etc but should we cover everything related to the led, we will proceed with that.</p>

<p>Hi Natalia,</p>
<p>I’ve successfully resurrected the original demo so your team and the head of product can access it for tomorrow&#39;s review. You can find the link here:</p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://natalia-anc.c9tnyg.easypanel.host/">https://natalia-anc.c9tnyg.easypanel.host/</a></p>
<p>Regarding the final project: I am currently integrating the math logic and branding from the Indiana project documents you shared yesterday to ensure the Excel mirroring is exact.</p>
<p>As I finalize the interface, I wanted to ask your preference: Would you like the final platform to look and feel exactly like this original demo, or would you prefer the more formal, marketing-focused layout we discussed in our last meeting (the one with the professional LOI headers and the formula-based Excel exports)?</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to the call with the estimators tomorrow!</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>Final platform or final pdf?</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [9:01 PM]</p>
<p>Final platform, the PDF is going to be the same on either one</p>
<p>[9:02 PM]I can give you  the link  for the one im working on now the one you  have seen, so it can  help you decide</p>

<p>Last time we spoke you said demo had some limitations</p>
<p>[9:03 PM]So whatever you showed today is great if that analyzes pdf, rfp files, extracts specs</p>
<p>[9:03 PM]Demo is just for a boss guy to get an idea on engine, not interface</p>
<p>[9:04 PM]It&#39;s whatever you know has more capabilities, looks don&#39;t matter to me</p>
<p>Ahmad Basheer  [9:14 PM]</p>
<p>The Final Product: Capabilities &amp; Workflow</p>
<p>THE INTERFACE (Split-Screen Efficiency)</p>
<p>• Left Side (Interactive Drafting Table): Tweak margins, dimensions, and project details.</p>
<p>• Right Side (Live Marketing Preview): The branded PDF flickers and updates instantly as you make changes.</p>
<p>• Intelligence Sidebar: A dedicated chat window connected to your specific RFP/Bid documents.</p>
<p>CORE ABILITIES</p>
<p>• RAG Document Intelligence: You can drop in a 30+ page RFP; the engine will extract screen sizes, quantities, and locations (e.g., Exhibit B) and auto-populate the forms.</p>
<p>• Master Excel Mirroring: A &#34;Pass-Through&#34; mode where you upload a pre-calculated estimator&#39;s Excel, and the system instantly skins it into a branded PDF, mirroring your specific row groupings and technical names.</p>
<p>• The &#34;Natalia Math&#34; Engine: Full implementation of the professional Divisor Margin model Cost/(1−Margin) and the 1.5% Performance Bond logic.</p>
<p>• Automatic Risk Detection: The AI flags expensive requirements like &#34;Union Labor&#34; or &#34;5% Spare Parts&#34; and ensures they are baked into the price.</p>
<p>• The Project Vault: A cloud-based history of every bid, so you can jump between a &#34;Chicago Fire&#34; bid and an &#34;Indiana Fever&#34; bid instantly—no data is ever lost.</p>
<p>THE WORKFLOW</p>
<p>Step 1 - Ingest: Drag &amp; drop your RFP PDF or your Estimator Excel.</p>
<p>Step 2 - Populate: The AI fills about 80% of the data (the &#34;17/20 logic&#34;). Visual &#34;Blue Glows&#34; show you exactly which fields the AI filled.</p>
<p>Step 3 - Gap Fill: You answer the remaining 2 or 3 questions in the chat (for example, &#34;Is this front or rear service?&#34;).</p>
<p>Step 4 - Verify &amp; Export:</p>
<p>• Branded PDF: A clean, marketing-ready proposal for the client that hides all internal costs and margins.</p>
<p>• Formulaic Excel: A structured &#34;Internal Audit&#34; file for Finance with live formulas.</p>
<p>Does this workflow capture your full vision for the team, or would you like to modify any of these steps</p>
<p>Natalia Kovaleva  [9:16 PM]</p>
<p>Natalia s math</p>
<p>[9:17 PM]This is great. Estimators may add scope extraction tomorrow or something we chat about but it will be within document intelligence</p>
<p>[9:18 PM]Like remove scope of work</p>
<p>[9:18 PM]Document intelligence is really broad so I do not see us needing anything else but again you are talking to estimating tomorrow to confirm everything</p>
