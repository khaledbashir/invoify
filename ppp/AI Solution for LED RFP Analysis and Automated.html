<h2 id="date-1-28-2026">Date: 1/28/2026</h2>
<p>[00:01] Yeah.</p>
<p>[00:19] How are you? Did you get a chance to work a little bit of what we talked about yesterday?</p>
<p>[00:24] I was yes actually working on it.</p>
<p>[00:26] Uh</p>
<p>[00:28] I shall just do it now.</p>
<p>[00:30] Uh yeah, and but that&#39;s why that&#39;s why it&#39;s not working.</p>
<p>[00:37] You take it.</p>
<p>[00:41] It will or it will not. It will not.</p>
<p>[00:45] Gotcha.</p>
<p>[00:46] Well it looks like Jeremy Joana. Hi Jeremy.</p>
<p>[00:50] You&#39;re still muted. That is nice to see a face.</p>
<p>[00:54] I turn camera just for you because I know you&#39;ll give me shit for not doing that. Yes, yes I will. Yes I will.</p>
<p>[01:02] Good morning ish.</p>
<p>[01:04] Good morning. Yeah, might have had to pass like eight hours, so I think it&#39;s like five, six, seven o&#39;clock at that time. Yeah. Not quite morning. Well you know.</p>
<p>[01:17] Before they got by, but I&#39;m very excited for you to meet Jeremy. He&#39;s our senior um representative of SD Media.</p>
<p>[01:26] department senior estimator and he&#39;s kinda running with all of our air piece and really important projects and he is there he knows anything and everything that we can have any questions on and uh Yeah. That is very true. When it comes to estimating it is very true. And I might have been I mean we can been working there.</p>
<p>[01:51] long together yet but I&#39;m very excited for what he can do for AMC based on just the demo and our conversation yesterday. My plan was for you and to give a little bit of a demo to Eric because he was not on my call when I was kind of introducing the solution. But Eric just messaged me that he&#39;s not gonna be joining the first thirty minutes. So we can skip that part and then once Eric joined me we&#39;ll keep it and give him like a couple of minutes of a demo or</p>
<p>[02:25] We will see if he can do it on his own time.</p>
<p>[02:28] based on where we are you know kind of things.</p>
<p>[02:31] So Jeremy yesterday Ahmad and I have met and we talked</p>
<p>[02:36] About</p>
<p>[02:38] my piece of the puzzle which is proposals. So we kind of I what I said was that there will be a lot of cases when we will be just dropping Excel with no calculations needed. And I didn&#39;t walk him through any type of how we arrived with this Excel. What clients gave us why the names are like this nothing. The assumption for conversation yesterday was that we have this Excel</p>
<p>[03:05] it&#39;s completely correct and I need to drop it into the software and receive uh branded idea the the the the way I wanted it with either being LOI or being a budget with different types of introduction with different types of</p>
<p>[03:22] Um</p>
<p>[03:23] And things different types of things. So we kind of talk about that and we we we&#39;re in a good place. I don&#39;t have many more questions left.</p>
<p>[03:33] And I promise that today you will kinda take him through the whole process of different types of</p>
<p>[03:40] uh situations how you can surprise the screen whether it&#39;s RP or it&#39;s a client messages to you or you see something in Salesforce</p>
<p>[03:52] and then all of your next steps like pricing everything yourself or you reach into the stuff or you need to do this or you need to do that and then how you reach out to our manufacturers and how they send information back to you can it be email excel what it is and then all of the steps</p>
<p>[04:10] So if you can kind of take it from there and do like a really deep dive into all of that process and if you can share some of the examples of Excels that you send to the SAPs, Excels that you sent to manufacturers, that will be super helpful. Either share your screen or pull up in a flat.</p>
<p>[04:29] Uh after the E here.</p>
<p>[04:35] Oh sure.</p>
<p>[04:36] Um</p>
<p>[04:38] Trying to think of</p>
<p>[04:39] So I will</p>
<p>[04:41] show you uh a lot of the projects that I&#39;m working on right now is um you know it&#39;s probably our largest project being uh being the Jacksonville Jaguar since I have most of uh</p>
<p>[04:51] I if you&#39;re not familiar.</p>
<p>[05:02] Yeah, indoor and outdoor technology which is</p>
<p>[05:07] Maybe our</p>
<p>[05:14] Yeah.</p>
<p>[05:43] we see like uh building connected which is like one of the kind of like um</p>
<p>[05:50] I guess agency use that platform to advertise about their job and in in in in in in in in in in in that that that that that that that that that that that uh that software</p>
<p>[05:58] you register with them and you tell them what business you are in and then any time the beat comes up that is stacked</p>
<p>[06:06] we receive a notification.</p>
<p>[06:08] So we receive a notification through our sources that this RFP is coming up, but also we receive like a building connected kind of link where all the people were sitting and then we downloaded everything to our server. Correct?</p>
<p>[06:25] So here&#39;s basically what we get from a customer. We get a an RFP request.</p>
<p>[06:36] with that link comes for you know generally those are the four cast that you get the overview of the project with</p>
<p>[09:11] Yeah, so these are basically like the standards.</p>
<p>[09:14] So like</p>
<p>[09:18] Like in the most simple form. It basically has the</p>
<p>[09:22] The rules for putting a bit together, right? So you have you know the main video screen is</p>
<p>[09:28] fifty feet tall by you know a hundred feet wide.</p>
<p>[09:32] Uh it&#39;s gotta be a certain pixel pitch, which is the spacing between the diodes.</p>
<p>[09:37] between the LED individual pixels on the screen, so it&#39;ll have that.</p>
<p>[09:44] There&#39;s a big brightness difference at the indoor and outdoor because one&#39;s fighting the summer and then one is not.</p>
<p>[09:53] I would get a</p>
<p>[09:55] I&#39;ll get a document.</p>
<p>[10:00] of pages right to find you know a twelve page document.</p>
<p>[10:07] So these are basically our two</p>
<p>[10:09] core documents that we&#39;re looking for when we&#39;re doing a a WGHW which is one of the large consultants here.</p>
<p>[10:16] Th these are the two core</p>
<p>[10:18] documents that we look at.</p>
<p>[10:30] She</p>
<p>[11:06] We have so we have thousands of thousands.</p>
<p>[11:15] information for every single trade so painting walls and then floor and this and that that&#39;s why there&#39;s thousands of pages is there a specific section number we can teach a system to scroll through to to extract is there always a section 10 11 0 6 0 0 is there like a five section options and our eldible always fall into those section like name</p>
<p>[11:42] Uh</p>
<p>[11:44] If it&#39;s in general construction, right. So if it&#39;s in a large construction project</p>
<p>[11:49] WHW generally has the same terms. So every WHW project is gonna have</p>
<p>[11:56] The eleven sixty three ten.</p>
<p>[11:59] uh every you know WJW project, I won&#39;t say every button.</p>
<p>[12:12] So if you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p>[12:40] Start when we find the</p>
<p>[12:44] If we don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>[13:19] These are the two dice.</p>
<p>[13:30] Uh would be AJP.</p>
<p>[13:31] and that person has a much smaller</p>
<p>[13:35] Package to sit through.</p>
<p>[13:38] Our assumption for this particular conversation for this stage of the game would be that regardless of the consultant, we will feed the software already extracted files, right? So it doesn&#39;t really matter for at this point of the game that much what consultant it is, because software will only receive the sections that are relevant. We kind of like agreeing on this at the moment, right? And then if on the road we figure out the way to to sorry.</p>
<p>[14:08] Now down the road we need enough information to the software that it says okay this looks like AJP software I found this section we will obviously take that. But for now we will</p>
<p>[14:21] If I if I may say Natalia, uh it would be uh</p>
<p>[14:26] thinking you would like to take this</p>
<p>[14:30] be great if we could um</p>
<p>[15:26] It&#39;s uh</p>
<p>[15:28] It&#39;s AI so it it&#39;s really easy for it. It doesn&#39;t uh matter</p>
<p>[15:33] Uh if it&#39;s a</p>
<p>[15:34] Section eleven three six or whatever, it it already knows. Yeah, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>[15:39] So these things um we can train it, we can use uh system prompts and we can give it a bunch of knowledge and it can extract</p>
<p>[15:48] L literally whatever you need. So what I&#39;m trying to say now, it would be great if I can get as much as</p>
<p>[16:00] Will be at at</p>
<p>[16:04] Easier for me to plan.</p>
<p>[16:08] I mean if you&#39;re telling us AI or AI it&#39;s easy to seek for thousands of documents and find two of our sections and for me and Jeremy it&#39;s just hard to wrap our heads around how it&#39;s gonna work, but you&#39;re telling us sure that&#39;s completely</p>
<p>[16:23] And AI will find everything you need, of course we will take it. I mean it probably takes Jeremy like an hour to find those files, right? If not more. So we can we can definitely say that we would like that, but if it&#39;s too complicated, we can also say okay we will still do that and it it&#39;s you know, what do you think Jeremy?</p>
<p>[16:47] Uh no, I mean I I think that&#39;s fine. If you can if you can take I guess from the simplest form, right, if you want to start from the very beginning, I think the best thing to do is to, you know, look at access. Maybe we look at access of giving you know him a a a a a a a a a a a sign in for you know, this project, right? So you get the uh the stadium of the future. You can start here. This is gonna be one of the largest file ingestions you&#39;re gonna find. Like when it gets to a different customer, when it&#39;s an actual just a replacement of a single screen, the scope of work is so much smaller, uh and it would be much faster. But like this is gonna be the largest one you&#39;re gonna find as you can see like this the the addendums are two hundred and seventy megabytes. I mean these things are you know, you have seven point seven gigabytes of just BIM models, which are so that would be my question for you on on on on on on on on on on on on what we&#39;re looking for here is we&#39;re gonna wanna build something where we can find the drawings that are the architecture</p>
<p>[17:43] The A B drawings. Um how would how how how how how how how how how how would AI pull just those drawings out?</p>
<p>[17:49] Or something you could do.</p>
<p>[17:52] I&#39;m sorry, if you can elaborate but when you say the drawings uh of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of</p>
<p>[17:58] So this is like a this is the files you&#39;ll download, right? So this is um but it&#39;s it&#39;s a thousand pages.</p>
<p>[18:05] So this is a thousand pages of construction documents. So these are gonna be all drawings of this big arena. Right. So this is um</p>
<p>[18:14] I&#39;m gonna go to page one just so you can one my o you know, computers struggle with these&#39;cause they&#39;re so big and there&#39;s like detailed line drawings of every single piece.</p>
<p>[18:24] So this is like a this is like a construction document set of of of just the concourses and halo video screens that are going into this stadium expansion, right? So we basically do this piece. We do the video screens, we do the video screens, we do all these roof video screens, any sort of LAD screens that are within the stadium, that&#39;s what we&#39;re pulling. So this thing is broken up into a bunch of sections. It&#39;s gonna be really hard to see, but I&#39;ll I&#39;ll zoom in. So basically we would want AI we would want AI to come in and review this document and they&#39;re gonna be looking for w we need like three sets of drawings, right? We need um the architectural drawings.</p>
<p>[19:02] which are listed as with an A, right? So all the architectural drawings are gonna be this little A right here. Um we need the</p>
<p>[19:11] Probably just the architectures uh and the A V drawings. So you&#39;ll see like these are labeled A6. So any architecture drawings are gonna be labeled A, and then any A V drawings, audio video drawings are gonna be labeled A V. And I can I I can zoom in a little further so you can see kind of what we&#39;re looking at, but so we need the A V the audio visual drawings. We would need those pulled out of the giant</p>
<p>[19:35] Fuller.</p>
<p>[19:36] And then we would need</p>
<p>[19:39] Um</p>
<p>[19:44] We would need the architecture. Yeah, why wh wh wh wh wh wh wh wh wh why don&#39;t we send this to you to see a couple of jumps? And then you&#39;ll let us know if that&#39;s possible or all. That would be perfect, yeah.</p>
<p>[19:54] Uh I I wanted to ask you so uh</p>
<p>[19:58] Pages. Um</p>
<p>[20:01] I mean uh to be honest uh the the the the the AI will not be able to do that but we we we we we we we we we we we should be able to figure out a way</p>
<p>[20:29] again this set of drawing is for every single trade so there&#39;s so many things that going into building the concourse and they&#39;re not gonna send every contractor their own set of drawings so they send this humanist document and telling us you guys find what you need and then price it so this is my human document that designer team did and then Jeremy who who who who who who who who who who who is from LED company will extract five pages that related to LED uh John Doe will go and find something for concrete somebody else will go find something for the roof out of this huge document so we don&#39;t need thousands of pages but this document is always gonna be huge because it pertains to every single trade so the question is can we tell uh software that we need everything that is easy with the keyboards of video course whatever whatever whatever whatever and everything that mentions those keywords extract those pages and that type of thing yes that was what I wanted to say so just to make it simple for me since I&#39;m not in the</p>
<p>[21:38] It&#39;s uh speak in normal computer la language.</p>
<p>[21:42] For example, if I am working with you and I work on L E D, you give me this one thousand pages, is it as simple as me doing</p>
<p>[22:07] Yeah, yeah, I I think for the most part you are, but like say this was so this is like your project manual, right? So I think I think the question is, I guess our first question is, will AI software work for drawings?</p>
<p>[22:19] And if the answer is no, that&#39;s okay. We just move on from there, know that we have to go physically pull the drawings out.</p>
<p>[22:26] And then two, this is the technical spec, right? So this is a volume which I think AI is gonna work through easily, but like as an example, this is p volume one of three and it&#39;s twenty five hundred pages.</p>
<p>[22:38] So for me, like you like you said, we&#39;ll go through and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll we usually type in the exact thing, right? So eleven sixty three thing.</p>
<p>[22:46] And that that generally will find it pretty fast, I think.</p>
<p>[22:50] I don&#39;t remember what I type in, but</p>
<p>[22:52] Maybe not.</p>
<p>[22:53] Uh let&#39;s see LED systems</p>
<p>[22:58] I know that it&#39;s in volume one, but</p>
<p>[23:01] You know, the AI system may not know it&#39;s annoying one. But</p>
<p>[23:06] Right. So the first th thing So go ahead. Okay Okay, so the first thing that really comes into my head right now since you know it&#39;s a huge document</p>
<p>[23:16] Basically like you said Natalia uh we would use keywords that you we predefine and to answer your question Jeremy yes uh we can definitely it will it it it it it it it it it it it can work on drawing</p>
<p>[23:30] We do it in steps.</p>
<p>[23:31] So the first step would be</p>
<p>[23:34] for where the specific drone</p>
<p>[23:39] For example, like I&#39;m just saying anything.</p>
<p>[23:44] If that&#39;s the one we want, we would have the that predefined.</p>
<p>[23:48] the A I would search for that specific page instead of going through a thousand pages now it will only go</p>
<p>[23:59] And once it does it we can uh prompt it. Basically we tell it, hey, we want you to do literally anything because it can</p>
<p>[24:07] it can see like it can see just th like you and I.</p>
<p>[24:11] Uh we will be using uh</p>
<p>[24:14] something called O C R</p>
<p>[24:15] Uh so it can see it and from there once it sees w we we can do literally anything you you want it to do.</p>
<p>[24:26] Mm.</p>
<p>[24:27] I mean this is this is good. We can we can kinda feed you a bunch of information. I will work with Jeremy to identify the large project and send you that and you can play with that and see if how how that works and then we will kinda check the accuracy compared to what Jeremy actually extracted versus what the software extracted and we will help you come up with like a list of twenty five keywords that are gonna be included in that for you to search. And then if that seems to be accurate and that piece seems to be working, that&#39;s great. If it still needs some tweaking like we will just know that for for for for for for for for for for for drawings most likely estimator will still have to extract himself or we will tweak the software to actually work. Um but I think we can give it a try, right, Jeremy? I mean it&#39;s always good to</p>
<p>[25:17] Yeah, I I think that&#39;s fine. I I think doing that is</p>
<p>[25:22] I I think</p>
<p>[25:25] don&#39;t know that the physical specs are the problem. Like the physical</p>
<p>[25:31] Yeah. Does it take a lot of time to find a specific drawing that has XYZ on it? It takes a lot of time. I don&#39;t know if the software is gonna be able to help it. When it comes to general construction, we do kinda have an idea of where it&#39;s going to be, right? Because stadium&#39;s been up in the</p>
<p>[25:47] You know, as as you can see from any construction drawing, right, the stadium&#39;s broken up into quads.</p>
<p>[25:53] You can generally see it&#39;s you know A, B, C, and D, so if you&#39;re looking for a you know a southwest video screen, it&#39;s gonna be somewhere down here. You know, if you&#39;re looking for a a n north east screen, it&#39;s gonna be somewhere up here. Like it&#39;s like it&#39;s not it&#39;s not hard to get through the general construction stuff. It just takes a lot of time. Um so if we could if we could I guess the option for the drawings, if we could figure out if there&#39;s an automation system to pool all the A B drawings, uh and all the architectural drawings and all the electrical drawings, that would be great. That would be option that would be where we would focus on from a drawing package specifically.</p>
<p>[26:31] Uh the project manual piece.</p>
<p>[26:34] I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p>[26:35] Really simple. I mean at the end of the day, right, so WGHW is is is is is is is is is is is in here ninety percent of the time.</p>
<p>[26:42] And ninety percent of the time it&#39;s gonna be called eleven sixty you know, eleven sixty three ten LED display systems.</p>
<p>[26:49] It&#39;s where it&#39;s always at. It&#39;s in Division 11. Uh this is also in Division 11. It&#39;s the Up Lady D display system display schedule. This is only in there probably like 40 to 50% of the time. And then sometimes that document is inside the drawing package. So that&#39;s where it gets a little a little less.</p>
<p>[27:05] Uh exciting. But yes, the division eleven is is is the is the easiest place to check. It&#39;s always in division eleven. Um or I would say ninety percent of the time it&#39;s in division eleven. Um and then so we go through, we find these pages. I mean at the end of the day, right, it&#39;s always gonna be if it&#39;s division eleven, it&#39;s generally in volume one. Uh so we go through volume one, if it tells if you pass the volume two side, then you know so into end of volume one, if it happens to be in like section you know, twenty one, then you know it&#39;s gonna be volume two, and then from there I think it&#39;s like sec section thirty is volume three. So um you know, I think that&#39;s pretty pretty simple, but when we get to larger projects there&#39;s gonna be an IP T V system piece that we may be looking at. Uh so there are different things that we could add on in the future. But from a hard specification I don&#39;t know if this is the most difficult thing to find.</p>
<p>[27:57] So I w if this is easy to do, then that&#39;s great. Uh it it would be the very beginning if you&#39;re looking to build the full you know, the full system is basically ingesting, you know, these twenty four hundred pages and pulling out those two documents. Each of those documents is I think the LED display systems documents is like thirty pages.</p>
<p>[28:17] Oh.</p>
<p>[28:18] Uh yeah, it&#39;s twenty nine pages and like the section of the display schedule is like twelve pages. So of those twenty five hundred pages of volume one, we need forty pages.</p>
<p>[28:28] Okay.</p>
<p>[28:29] But uh this once we build the system and if it&#39;s working we can tell her look for division eleven equipment and then also at uh once the system of search is in place we can can we add additional division Ahmad let&#39;s say and also division twelve IP T&#39;s gonna be already within the build system, right? It&#39;s just like extra words to search for. Um I&#39;m sorry, I I did not catch that.</p>
<p>[28:58] Repeat?</p>
<p>[28:58] So let&#39;s say once you build a system that uh um ing ingested the file and identified the each other sorry my slack is I can figure out a way to shut it up. Um once you build the system to um</p>
<p>[29:16] to uh identify pages we can always add add add add add add add add add add additional keywords correct? Yeah yeah</p>
<p>[29:23] Okay. We can start with LED key warrant and then if the system is in place we can say and also search for IPTB and search for whatever. It shouldn&#39;t be that hard.</p>
<p>[29:33] Eric join us. Hi Eric, how are you?</p>
<p>[29:37] I am.</p>
<p>[29:39] My Eric, he&#39;s our um uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh head of product and and expert on anything and everything that goes to LED projects.</p>
<p>[29:49] He is kind of helping us pick the right product, identify what&#39;s gonna work here, what&#39;s not gonna work, how to service this, like and any type of question related to from LED pricing to product to servicing, we always go to Eric.</p>
<p>[30:06] Nice.</p>
<p>[30:09] Nice to meet you. It&#39;s A Ahmad. It&#39;s Ahmad, yeah.</p>
<p>[30:13] Yeah.</p>
<p>[30:16] We started to go for um how we um</p>
<p>[30:21] So yesterday we spoke about like my piece which is PGF file which is very straightforward and now we&#39;re doing a deep dive into every step that goes into A and C DC being a project and what next steps Jeremy and Matt are taking to price it. So so far we talked about a big opportunity that Jeremy is kind of describing which is Jacksonville, how we go to building connected downloading files, then uh he goes and manually searches for the right specifications and then uh um the right drawings and kind of extract those files that will help him in a future pricing that</p>
<p>[31:01] Um so once you extract that what what is the next bad Jeremy?</p>
<p>[31:07] Um</p>
<p>[31:08] I mean the next step for us is</p>
<p>[31:11] We we kinda started until I like the April&#39;s cheap. And I think that&#39;s where it might be, you know, who of us to talk about</p>
<p>[31:19] Uh</p>
<p>[31:21] East himself also, you know, with Eric&#39;s timing it may be a g a a a a a a a a a a good opportunity to kinda break into the</p>
<p>[31:27] Excel sheet side of it, which is where we&#39;re gonna uh</p>
<p>[31:30] Spend most of our time kinda building out what that product sheet looks like.</p>
<p>[31:35] Oh perfect.</p>
<p>[31:37] Um</p>
<p>[31:41] all the spec feet that we have or</p>
<p>[31:44] Jack Wars and this is probably</p>
<p>[31:46] What takes the largest amount of time.</p>
<p>[31:53] And Eric since uh we kind of see the introduction, you join us a little bit later, we will send you a link to the demo to play on your own to see what the demo look like and you can kinda get a feel of of of of the future uh situation and then uh see how that whole thing will work. But I guess it&#39;s it&#39;s better use of our time right now to talk about the product.</p>
<p>[32:13] Um and you help us guide there.</p>
<p>[32:18] So we had um</p>
<p>[32:20] So we have this this this this this this this this this this this product that I talked about, right? The display system schedule. Um we take that schedule, we go through so these are all the individual screens, so you&#39;re gonna have you know, basically the location, the size, the technology, which probably doesn&#39;t mean much.</p>
<p>[32:37] to you uh the the the the the notes for the screen which is what you proposed on you can essentially look for to find and not all of them have that but and this kinda tells you the location within the facility of where the product is gonna be stored at. So we&#39;re basically we&#39;re taking this product</p>
<p>[32:54] the four millimeter the the resolution the location the height and width and we&#39;re creating an XL sheet.</p>
<p>[33:04] Or for the Jacksaw Jack wise the base bit is thirty two video screens.</p>
<p>[33:09] Created this little sheet that it kind of breaks out everything that we need to have uh for the customer. And it it it&#39;s like shouldn&#39;t it be</p>
<p>[33:18] you know, specialized I would say. You know what we are doing. So how do you do that right now? Do you take PDF export it into Excel or you manually type all of this? Uh right now you manually insert one screen at a time.</p>
<p>[33:31] So you take the FPTF and literally type every single name from that page?</p>
<p>[33:35] Uh yes.</p>
<p>[33:37] Okay.</p>
<p>[33:39] It has to be a lot of times it has to be broken out price wise, it has to be broken out as they request it. So we basically go in, we we h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h highlight every screen.</p>
<p>[33:48] Now given this is a this is a you know a very large project, there&#39;s generally not fifty displays, but</p>
<p>[33:56] This is this would be worst case scenario. And yes, this is a major problem.</p>
<p>[34:00] I mean it takes me.</p>
<p>[34:04] A day. But it takes a while to insert every screen, go through the list, find all the alternates, pick the right product.</p>
<p>[34:10] The right height and width. Uh because we&#39;re building that height and width based on our property.</p>
<p>[34:16] this would be where where where where where where where where where where where automation is helpful. Right. Right. We would type in the details of the screen.</p>
<p>[34:20] You know, maybe it&#39;s better to not have these to do this description and the size, you know, correctly or or together. Maybe you have the name of the screen, the size here, and then automation is gonna take the height and width of our panels of information that we put in and kinda fill the rest of this out, right? Like what&#39;s the brightness of</p>
<p>[34:38] That&#39;s the size of the screen. And basically we take all of that.</p>
<p>[34:43] to create</p>
<p>[34:45] uh a list of video screens uh for the stadium. And then we have a second list which is the alternates tab, which would be kind of a second point like this does not go into the base bid. And then we have uh this and there&#39;s a unique one&#39;cause this is like a third option. There&#39;s additional alternates that all currently exist. So these are new alternates.</p>
<p>[35:02] Right here, these are new alternates. These are replacement of existing screens, and then this is like base bit.</p>
<p>[35:09] But for the sake of like um</p>
<p>[35:12] It is literally you see all of them listed on one of the pages of the PDF that you just showed us.</p>
<p>[35:21] you came up with a column A, right?</p>
<p>[35:24] So basically here&#39;s your sheet here, here&#39;s uh the the schedule values of the display, here&#39;s the height and width, and we&#39;re basically coordinating that in into our Excel sheet on every line.</p>
<p>[35:34] So this is you know screen one, two, three, four, just like that, and then this page over here just keeps going.</p>
<p>[35:41] So it&#39;s just page after page after page of data.</p>
<p>[35:44] Mm-hmm. And then once you type all of this in how you said the longest part it takes to find the right product</p>
<p>[35:57] is gonna have a unique size cabinet.</p>
<p>[36:00] So every screen is gonna be so for four millimeter I would say they&#39;re not all different, but for the</p>
<p>[36:07] There is gonna be a different in pixel spacing of every display, so you have ten millimeter product, eight millimeter product, six millimeter product, four millimeter product.</p>
<p>[36:15] all of those displays have a different size and a different pixel count.</p>
<p>[36:20] So we are then going through and like as an example here, like if w if if if if if if if if if if we know that the screen is, you know, three point two eight t t t t t t t t t tall</p>
<p>[36:28] um we would then need to input that data in, right? So every module will be three foot and we try to get to the closest cabinet size. Where Eric&#39;s gonna come in and you know is gonna help I think is he has a sheet that has the cabinet and the cabinet size for each one.</p>
<p>[36:44] And if we can get those logged into an automation system and it&#39;s just like it automatically does it, then each screen would be a lot faster, right? So all these things would be automatically filled out.</p>
<p>[36:54] the height and width of the screen, the pixel count, height and width.</p>
<p>[36:57] Uh then you put the quantity in obviously and then that&#39;s gonna know that it&#39;s a seventy five hundred net product, which is the brightness of the screen.</p>
<p>[37:05] Oh to so you have this Excel that you type and then you open another Excel with with with existing products.</p>
<p>[37:11] and you match to the closest cabinet side that&#39;s slightly smaller</p>
<p>[37:17] Yes.</p>
<p>[37:19] And um can we share that uh like product uh catalogue? Of course we will have to share the product catalogue and then we will have to change the software that for four millimeter peach we have this many product</p>
<p>[37:33] And then if the size of the client screen is 13.5</p>
<p>[37:38] it needs to find the right like cabinet size which is slightly smaller. Did I get it correctly?</p>
<p>[37:45] That is correct, but I don&#39;t know if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if</p>
<p>[37:49] Eric and and I would say.</p>
<p>[37:52] She is ready for</p>
<p>[37:54] Ingestation.</p>
<p>[37:57] Yeah, um there&#39;s some new things obviously that we&#39;ve learned that we think and we probably need to do it for all of Yahem&#39;s products which we don&#39;t have it at all. Right.</p>
<p>[38:06] Yeah.</p>
<p>[38:07] So</p>
<p>[38:08] There&#39;s more. Well this is the software is only as good as what information we feed it. So we can just for our own homework in I A A A A A A A A A AMC we can kind of make it like a major priority to keep this information up to date. As soon as we get new product, we will be feeding the software, this new product, and whatever you have right now we can just ingest and keep adding.</p>
<p>[38:33] I think the um</p>
<p>[38:38] I think the change in the LG sheet, Jeremy, is not cabinet size. I think we should go to module size.</p>
<p>[38:44] So then then then then then then then then then then then the system can then building block my modules.</p>
<p>[38:49] Um</p>
<p>[38:51] I think the uh we we&#39;re getting the the the products that we&#39;re using are getting pretty close to um</p>
<p>[38:56] Having all the customers.</p>
<p>[38:58] Yeah, hide and west we need.</p>
<p>[38:59] Um</p>
<p>[39:01] But in full modules. Uh so</p>
<p>[39:04] That&#39;s a change I gotta make on that sheet. Right now it&#39;s set up as</p>
<p>[39:08] Um</p>
<p>[39:09] And then I&#39;m gonna sign I assign Curry to to put something together for all the product lines for indoor outdoor</p>
<p>[39:16] Um fine pitch or</p>
<p>[39:19] Uh yeah, I am.</p>
<p>[39:21] with these line items, right? The product name</p>
<p>[39:25] The pitch.</p>
<p>[39:26] modules, module, building block, sizes, and</p>
<p>[39:30] Yeah, the the few specs that we need. So</p>
<p>[39:33] Pixel density, brightness.</p>
<p>[39:37] So on and so forth.</p>
<p>[39:39] That would be amazing. And then uh is there like a simple calculation like um</p>
<p>[39:44] But they I have never done it never matched</p>
<p>[39:46] the cabinet size or module size to this, like I don&#39;t understand like I understand that the software will be able to do that, but is there a formula you use to calculate all of that or</p>
<p>[39:57] Can you show like another size will be ten inches by ten inches, let&#39;s call it.</p>
<p>[40:02] And Jeremy&#39;s</p>
<p>[40:05] the ingested screen sizes</p>
<p>[40:08] Yeah, ten point five feet by ten point five feet. And it&#39;ll you know, there&#39;s a simple math equation for how many ten inch modules get ten point five feet.</p>
<p>[40:20] Okay, so we will be able to share death and th th th th th th th th th those calculations with Ahmad so he understands this because</p>
<p>[40:27] Uh okay, great.</p>
<p>[40:32] L E D in Justin Sheets.</p>
<p>[40:35] is in module by module. And then you y unless I&#39;m wrong, M M M M M M M M M Matt and Johnny you tell me, but then you can very simply Yeah, we can get to this close</p>
<p>[40:45] with uh you know, sing sing sing sing sing sing sing sing sing sing single modules or one one one one one one one one one one one and a half modules or half module, whatever.</p>
<p>[40:53] And gets that close to the screen size.</p>
<p>[40:58] Yeah.</p>
<p>[41:00] So that is something we need to provide um kind of like the supported line for the sported information for every single um manufacturer that we work with. Yeah. Okay, great.</p>
<p>[41:13] So we um we put the name of the product based on the RP, based on this one PDF page that we either will software will find this PDF page itself or we will extract this PDF page depending on how the software is looking and we uh have this Excel set up with the names of the screen in column A and then we will tell the software that for this exercise we wanna use LED from lighthouse uh from LG let&#39;s say for outdoor and for Yaham for indoor and software will look in the right catalogs for the right products.</p>
<p>[41:54] Think so.</p>
<p>[41:57] Pixel peach because sometimes the client will say four millimeter, but we don&#39;t have any four millimeter, the closest one will be three point nine.</p>
<p>[42:08] So it will need to adjust to exactly what we have in our catalogue from millimeter peach to height to width to pixel and height and pixel width. And fill out all of it.</p>
<p>[42:25] Display</p>
<p>[42:26] The the size in the RPG.</p>
<p>[42:29] And then I think it might be up to us then to pick.</p>
<p>[42:32] You know a drop down menu. I don&#39;t know. You tell them I don&#39;t even know what exactly what what this is gonna look like. I didn&#39;t see the demo. So are you picking the vendor? LG, products.</p>
<p>[42:42] GSQA, 8mm, or whatever. Outdoor, indoor. Are you p are you picking those items or you or is it automating is that is that is it automating to that?</p>
<p>[42:54] So I think that is the discussion, right? So we have this</p>
<p>[42:58] Right now Ahmad is trying to create a massive footprint of what this thing ultimately is gonna look like. So right now we&#39;re talking about it ingesting all of the stuff that we have, right? So the big RFP files. And basically from those RFP files it will pull out the things that are important for us from a from a large perspective.</p>
<p>[43:20] From an Excel sheet, I don&#39;t think we really dove into exactly what we want it to look like. Uh, but I think that is</p>
<p>[43:28] what we&#39;re discussing now, like we want it to</p>
<p>[43:31] And yeah. We want it to</p>
<p>[43:33] do the basics of everything, right? So when we say the video screen the issue is the North Main concourse and the size, then all the rest would be automated, right? So if we say the screen is thirteen feet tall by twenty four feet wide, I think that we want to start there.</p>
<p>[43:49] But I think it even start further where you literally just do it automatically.</p>
<p>[43:55] I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>[43:57] No. E even the demo did it automatically. Even in the demo still indoor and outdoor. I think we need both options. I think we have to have an option of saying find the right LG product for me, or we we we we we we we we we we we need an option to say it&#39;s gonna be LG, let me pick exactly which one I want. And if it&#39;s a budget, we will just say pick the you know something for me and then it&#39;s gonna do whatever.</p>
<p>[44:24] like this we want to say like I want to identify the product uh model</p>
<p>[44:31] Well maybe you don&#39;t even like if it&#39;s if it calls it out as</p>
<p>[44:34] Four millimeter outdoor.</p>
<p>[44:37] then it&#39;s gonna give you our two glasses. We have uh</p>
<p>[44:40] Yeah, uh LD option and uh.</p>
<p>[44:44] You don&#39;t think maybe maybe you don&#39;t need it, because you&#39;re gonna want both.</p>
<p>[44:47] You don&#39;t want to see. Yeah, you&#39;re gonna want to the the the question is.</p>
<p>[44:51] Is it gonna is that is it gonna matter to you know the the only thing that it would be the difference is if LG or Yaw or or or or or or or or or or or Yah have a different cabinet size, right? So there may be an option where you know maybe they don&#39;t have a Yah Ham has a mesh product and LG doesn&#39;t. So if you type in LG mesh it may pop up with no options.</p>
<p>[45:17] And then if both of them have an option, you get both of them.</p>
<p>[45:20] And then you can you you you you you you can you can see the price comparison. Or you can see maybe the size maybe the module size determines what&#39;s the better option.</p>
<p>[45:29] Yeah, I&#39;m not sure.</p>
<p>[45:33] and is that we get the sheet set up where we say, Hey, we want a video screen, here&#39;s the name of the screen, here&#39;s the size of the screen</p>
<p>[45:42] And then the automation does the rest.</p>
<p>[45:46] Same of the screen, size of the screen. Pixel pitch.</p>
<p>[45:49] Uh I I am, I I I am definitely yeah. Uh the only uh</p>
<p>[46:17] sure there uh once I get my w once I get everything from you guys I I&#39;m sure I can you know</p>
<p>[46:40] Um</p>
<p>[46:45] And then the second</p>
<p>[46:47] It&#39;d be uh almost like uh almost like a chat GPT line.</p>
<p>[46:52] So I don&#39;t know if you can see my screen right now.</p>
<p>[46:56] Yeah.</p>
<p>[46:57] So basically um</p>
<p>[47:00] So uh well me and Natalia we were working on uh the first uh part of the project which is the mirroring.</p>
<p>[47:08] It&#39;s basically when you drop an um you drop an an an an an an an an an an an an exhale</p>
<p>[47:20] Like uh the items.</p>
<p>[47:23] It literally just parses it extract.</p>
<p>[47:31] In the right field it will be uh just like the uh the one</p>
<p>[47:38] And</p>
<p>[47:39] Uh stuff like that. So I I I I I I I I I I I I was thinking too</p>
<p>[47:46] One of them would be strategic.</p>
<p>[47:50] The strategic would be this one, the intelligence.</p>
<p>[47:58] Yeah.</p>
<p>[48:19] And you&#39;re talking about the interface of the software, right? When you say uh you&#39;re trying we&#39;re trying to figure out which interface will work better for us, okay. So one interface has a preview on the right hand side, everything you can see right away how it&#39;s gonna look like. And another solution interface will look like this. Right? Uh yeah, but but it&#39;s not only about the interface uh uh uh uh yeah by itself. It&#39;s about the actual um uh features that we can have, for example.</p>
<p>[48:56] So if I can show you quickly right here, like for example I I I just did this real quick just for me to wrap my head around uh</p>
<p>[49:04] Basically we would give it something uh you know imagine you are you are you have an intern.</p>
<p>[49:37] uh what you call like a folder.</p>
<p>[49:41] For example client A B C</p>
<p>[49:44] I think ABC would have uh let&#39;s say A this one.</p>
<p>[49:52] Yeah.</p>
<p>[49:54] For example, what you would do is something like this. It it it extracts the tabs so it&#39;s one one F</p>
<p>[50:08] really depends on how large the model the language model we have and the settings and bunch of technical stuff.</p>
<p>[50:15] that we can uh discuss or such later. But right now what what is what what&#39;s going on</p>
<p>[50:21] See updating the worst place. This is a really big file, so it&#39;s taken its time.</p>
<p>[50:26] Now what&#39;s happen what&#39;s what what&#39;s going on is that once it takes I I I I I I I I I I I I want to show you but it will take some time.</p>
<p>[50:49] So for example I really because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in</p>
<p>[50:54] So we can ask it questions.</p>
<p>[51:01] Uh I will</p>
<p>[51:08] Yeah.</p>
<p>[51:15] So if I just say hi, I I just want you to see</p>
<p>[51:19] What it would say.</p>
<p>[51:21] Mm.</p>
<p>[51:27] Estimated.</p>
<p>[51:42] Well we make sure everybody saw that. Yeah.</p>
<p>[51:48] So what&#39;s well?</p>
<p>[51:51] we that you know it&#39;s basically propping me to do something.</p>
<p>[51:58] Do I want to give it um</p>
<p>[52:01] Uh</p>
<p>[52:02] an RFP or do I want to give it an an an an an an an an an an an analysis so it can give me</p>
<p>[52:09] Text which will then become uh</p>
<p>[52:13] A PDM.</p>
<p>[52:13] So I would for example because I really don&#39;t know what&#39;s in there, I don&#39;t know what to ask but</p>
<p>[52:20] Um could you um</p>
<p>[52:22] Uh extra</p>
<p>[52:27] The name</p>
<p>[52:33] From</p>
<p>[52:42] Yeah.</p>
<p>[52:44] And it will call me stupid basically. It will say like what are you talking about?</p>
<p>[52:48] Yeah, if we can yeah.</p>
<p>[52:50] Uh</p>
<p>[52:52] Yeah, doing its thing, it&#39;s doing its thing because but but but because I gave it nothing. Like literally everything that you see right now is nothing because I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p>[53:02] the the knowledge defeated</p>
<p>[53:06] Now it&#39;s all of this is just thinking.</p>
<p>[53:08] only thinking how to respond that.</p>
<p>[53:11] Based on Indiana, there&#39;s uh it&#39;s telling me what</p>
<p>[53:16] Now do I trust it? No.</p>
<p>[53:18] uh they hallucinate. But how do I make sure is uh</p>
<p>[53:23] I didn&#39;t do it.</p>
<p>[53:26] How I make sure it will give me um it will give me a little like uh link at the end with the context.</p>
<p>[53:34] Where did it exactly pull it from?</p>
<p>[53:40] So would you like me to apply these requirements to document you up?</p>
<p>[53:44] I would say</p>
<p>[53:45] Um</p>
<p>[53:46] Anything.</p>
<p>[53:48] If you can help me Natalia with like w what should I say now? Yeah, I&#39;m not I&#39;m not really ending this this uh this engine yet, so I c I I I don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re doing. So um</p>
<p>[54:10] How the end.</p>
<p>[54:22] Why don&#39;t you show you the the next?</p>
<p>[54:32] Is it uh</p>
<p>[54:34] You can see what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p>[54:39] sure that it&#39;s not hallucinating or it&#39;s actually pulling</p>
<p>[54:45] So it did this, for example.</p>
<p>[55:02] Because th this is not uh done but</p>
<p>[55:25] No.</p>
<p>[55:33] Literally uh anything.</p>
<p>[55:38] Yeah. So imagine this. This this would be your table with whatever you need.</p>
<p>[55:45] Uh</p>
<p>[55:46] We can make it uh do anything.</p>
<p>[55:49] I&#39;m sorry to interrupt you. I think it&#39;s a little bit hard for anybody who is like</p>
<p>[55:54] It&#39;s really hard for us to envision what is gonna be the advantage of this uh engine versus the demo engine. So we are kind of feeding you all the things that we&#39;re expecting the engine to do and we&#39;re looking for you to to come up with the right engine and then teach us how to use it. So the other one seems to be a little bit more uh straightforward and like uh I would say people with no AI knowledge friendly, it had like a preview, you can type your stuff, so it&#39;s easy. But if it&#39;s like some of the uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh things that we needed to do like analyze PDF, extract information from PDF, we don&#39;t need anything that&#39;s pretty but like some function. If this is the right engine that has all the function and you can set it up to uh for us to understand it a little bit more and show us next time, that will be great. For now it&#39;s really hard to like digest what I&#39;m looking at and all of the things on the on the l le left like hello mean the default like I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening and it&#39;s hard for me to understand the the benefit of this engine. So what sets it apart from the demo one? That&#39;s what I&#39;m actually uh asking like so I know which which which which which which which which which which which approach to take. So it means try to make it simple. This one.</p>
<p>[57:13] This one is visual as you can see. It it gives it you give it uh you give it an Excel sheet, it becomes a uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh a PDF</p>
<p>[57:25] with everything else from here, the entire uh the the what we call the ugly exercise.</p>
<p>[57:31] It will be it will be here. Um but it&#39;s yeah.</p>
<p>[57:36] It will be here.</p>
<p>[57:39] The the problem is not working right now. Uh I I can&#39;t I can&#39;t really show you.</p>
<p>[57:43] Uh that&#39;s what one of that&#39;s that&#39;s it really. Uh and then</p>
<p>[57:48] you know, we can we can uh build on top of it.</p>
<p>[57:52] However, w the reason I&#39;m thinking this is because</p>
<p>[57:56] you can feed it um you can feed it all these documents that we discussed</p>
<p>[58:02] Literally you chat with it, like you just discussed stuff.</p>
<p>[58:06] with it and so on and imagine this which we just got</p>
<p>[58:11] can be anything like imagine it just like uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh just like like like like like like like like like like like we did in the first demo for example it asks you a bunch of questions you answer or if you can give it a document for example it extracted uh for example there are twenty questions</p>
<p>[58:27] We were able to extract seven T from the R from the</p>
<p>[58:32] Uh there&#39;s uh three left. It will ask you the three. Uh it will not give you a uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh an and</p>
<p>[58:40] Client facing.</p>
<p>[58:41] Until you answer all these questions.</p>
<p>[58:44] Yeah it will be that.</p>
<p>[58:45] And then you have this document editor, literally it&#39;s like a document editor.</p>
<p>[58:51] Uh</p>
<p>[58:59] So there uh and you have work spaces. So each one</p>
<p>[59:03] It&#39;s a work space. Meaning each client has has those.</p>
<p>[59:08] And each client like imagine like a workspace has</p>
<p>[59:13] Folders and threads</p>
<p>[59:15] Yeah.</p>
<p>[59:16] So that&#39;s how you keep organized.</p>
<p>[59:18] And much of other features, honestly, but that but yeah, that&#39;s why that&#39;s why I wanted to just</p>
<p>[59:24] want you to visualize these two things</p>
<p>[59:28] Uh I just wanted you to see these two things. So I can know at the end of the day w w w w w w w w w w w which</p>
<p>[59:34] Where to go? Like which one which one excited you the most? Uh that&#39;s what I meant to say.</p>
<p>[59:41] So can you bring it up?</p>
<p>[59:47] Screen share there.</p>
<p>[59:49] I&#39;m sorry, you you were breaking for a second.</p>
<p>[59:53] Oh no, can you just uh sh sh</p>
<p>[59:55] Share your screen again with those two things up. I just have a question for you on those things you&#39;re showing. Yeah.</p>
<p>[60:06] Yeah.</p>
<p>[60:09] So on your so basically you said like your two options were</p>
<p>[60:14] Your first option was</p>
<p>[60:17] Like not that they eat.</p>
<p>[60:20] So</p>
<p>[60:21] And there was the</p>
<p>[60:23] Well was kind of an easier one just from the eyes perspective, but</p>
<p>[60:28] Proposal engine was was better from like kind of the</p>
<p>[60:33] You know, from the big picture has a little work as what you&#39;re getting on it in but on your automation page when you had like the original one that said hello. I guess it was one at the top left it said basically like the chat and then add like the the the the the the the the the the the the document and then add like the form. So those are like basically tiers to creating like the final document.</p>
<p>[60:54] So you would basically make the edits in</p>
<p>[60:58] Um in the first one in the</p>
<p>[61:01] Um. So you make the edits in like the chat, right? So the chat G B T types where you&#39;re a a a a a a a a a a asking all the questions.</p>
<p>[61:07] And then the second one was</p>
<p>[61:09] uh where you&#39;re basically proofing what ready and then the fourth or the third one being forms would be where</p>
<p>[61:15] Uh is that like the final</p>
<p>[61:17] Uh yeah. So so so the forms is uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh is not actually uh has nothing to do with A and C or at least for now like I I haven&#39;t uh thought uh that out yet.</p>
<p>[61:30] Uh but yes, the chat and the docs are definitely related to to the project.</p>
<p>[61:36] So what would happen</p>
<p>[61:39] The basically is this. You would you would literally like in a workflow I would I would like create a new client. I would say uh A A B C client</p>
<p>[61:49] and then you would have a new workspace. And that workspace uh</p>
<p>[61:54] you know depending on what what what what what what what what what what what we tell it and what we feed it you can come here</p>
<p>[62:00] and you will you would have folders. So for example you have you know folders for RPs uh</p>
<p>[62:08] For this for this, for the Yeah, for that.</p>
<p>[62:11] Once you do that</p>
<p>[62:12] You can</p>
<p>[62:14] You know drag drag in here and end that</p>
<p>[62:17] Now when I say embed is like uh that&#39;s it, you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re training them. You you&#39;re you&#39;re training the agent</p>
<p>[62:24] on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on the knowledge. Now</p>
<p>[62:28] The only thing would be left is the the big uh or how</p>
<p>[62:36] handle a thousand or you know, document.</p>
<p>[62:40] That&#39;s the only issue I&#39;m trying to figure out. If I could</p>
<p>[62:43] Like if we can find a way to where we can make the the the number less than that in a way, I think this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this would be the perfect solution honestly.</p>
<p>[62:53] Because it has a lot of features and I can go through it but I&#39;m not prepared to be honest right now and uh this is</p>
<p>[63:03] No, I I think that&#39;s fine. I I I I I I I I I I think um you know, pulling out the eleven sixty three ten or or the AJP R P and dropping</p>
<p>[63:11] I think that&#39;s the demarcation point.</p>
<p>[63:14] you know, ingesting ten thousand you know, documents at one time is</p>
<p>[63:19] It&#39;s is</p>
<p>[63:21] gonna be helpful for all involved. Maybe</p>
<p>[63:25] Too much.</p>
<p>[63:27] Yes. Uh so I just wanted to ask you like qu just so I can uh kind of un</p>
<p>[63:34] Which uh which one do you guys think uh would be more beneficial for you from what you from the little things that you just saw?</p>
<p>[63:44] Um</p>
<p>[63:47] I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>[63:48] I mean again I I I I I I I I uh I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I think this is a question for you. We come to you as an expert to tell us like this is the better solution because it can do this and that and that. I do not know for me it&#39;s very hard to answer. The one looks pretty and the one doesn&#39;t that&#39;s all I can tell you. Like I don&#39;t understand the the the differences or on the final things and not the capabilities of the software. So we&#39;re looking for everything we just discussed you and we&#39;re just getting started. So we still have to go through how we calculate all the um uh installation pieces we still have to go through how we calculate control system we still have to go through that. But now we discovered how we got documents and it&#39;s just one way of many sometimes we receive email, sometimes we receive this and that. So we seem to agree on the thing that we will upload some type of</p>
<p>[64:40] Uh.</p>
<p>[64:45] with PGF or PGF of Salesforce or something that has displays and then will feed the software with Excel.</p>
<p>[64:53] uh with all of our products and then software will take it from there. So whichever software can do it better, that&#39;s the software we need.</p>
<p>[65:01] And we will learn eventually how to use all of them. We will do trainings with you to see how we can learn how to use it. Okay. Do you guys agree with me, Erica and Jeremy?</p>
<p>[65:15] Yeah. Yeah, I I think ultimately our goal is to tell you what information we have and then you say this is the platform for you. Like the first</p>
<p>[65:28] As far as what we&#39;re looking for to do. So I don&#39;t think we have a print for which system. H here&#39;s all the data that we&#39;re using. Here&#39;s all the data that we&#39;re trying to tr tr tr tr tr tr tr tr tr try to pars in into AI. Uh,</p>
<p>[65:41] Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>[65:42] Okay.</p>
<p>[65:44] Uh okay, so uh what would be uh great is uh after you send me all those uh documents we discussed and so on, I can study everything and I can come up with a plan.</p>
<p>[66:00] Yeah, I recommend this one or that one.</p>
<p>[66:04] Okay, great. So I will take upon myself to share a couple of examples from different um</p>
<p>[66:11] Consultants, how we receive our fees, so you will see just the plain text where they&#39;re just leave lease screens, you will see the table like Jeremy showed, you will see different different things. I will send you five or six examples like that. Uh Jeremy and Eric if you can send anything you have on different products.</p>
<p>[66:31] Like th th th th th th th th th th those excels from actually air both LEDs and L C D&#39;s</p>
<p>[66:39] the catalog with sizes with what I we just discussed, uh wh when you can share that and uh that will be great.</p>
<p>[66:48] Yeah, no problem. I actually have the um maybe the best I don&#39;t know, maybe the best route is just feed in the</p>
<p>[66:55] I don&#39;t have L C D, but maybe LG does in their that cheat sheet. They&#39;re uh</p>
<p>[67:02] quarterly updated pricing sheet.</p>
<p>[67:07] Yeah, whatever you can share with us will be great, but we&#39;ll aga aga aga aga aga aga aga aga aga again, we g the the the the the the the the the the system will be as good as the uh obviously the amount of information from manufacturers we get to it. So it&#39;ll be great. And then I think that&#39;s it. I think that&#39;s where the demarcation point needs needs to be. Like I wanna focus primarily on the LED piece. Yeah, I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think but L C D is gonna be fifty five you know, give me a hundred and fifty five inch T V. That&#39;s not</p>
<p>[67:35] You know, in you know, sucking up our time at the moment. Like the LED piece is w is the biggest thing. Can we add L C D at a later time? I I think so, but for today I would rather focus on the LED piece because those are the more ever changing and you know, ninety percent of our workload.</p>
<p>[67:54] We we can have a different agent for it I mean this is just a quick idea I just had I&#39;m not sure if it makes sense, but we can have a different agent for uh e e e e e e e e e each product.</p>
<p>[68:07] Yeah.</p>
<p>[68:08] which which would basically uh know uh all the specifications about uh for example LED and so on and so forth. And another one for another</p>
<p>[68:20] Uh.</p>
<p>[68:22] So because like if you cannot share like all of the catalogue and you can share for example one thing, we can we can treat it as one employee or one agent for that specific</p>
<p>[68:33] And then we can hire let&#39;s say call it higher more as we go.</p>
<p>[68:39] Yeah, so agent one is L E D, agent two will be L C D, but it&#39;ll come later. Yeah.</p>
<p>[68:46] Yeah, that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p>[68:48] Okay, so we kind of uh w w went through a little bit over the beginning of the stages. We will need a couple more full-ups for sure to talk about all the pricing of the installation and things like this. So I don&#39;t know, Eric, do you wanna um be part of the installation conversation as well? Should I drag you through things? Yeah, sure. I I I&#39;m gonna get Curry working on Yahem pricing sheet right now. I appreciate that. And</p>
<p>[69:17] Uh</p>
<p>[69:20] And then I&#39;ll I&#39;ll</p>
<p>[69:22] Dig into uh my LG cheat sheet, see if what we have works.</p>
<p>[69:28] They make those major ch changes module by module change.</p>
<p>[69:32] We really appreciate your time helping me to set this up and Ahmad of course your time listening to all of this and if you have any questions as you I I&#39;ll need a little bit of time today to compile all of this together, but I will send what I promised different examples from different consultants no later than end of the day today. And then when we look at this tomorrow if you have questions just let me know. Yes.</p>
<p>[69:59] Thank you, everybody. Thank you, and I&#39;ll let it follow up for a week to to meet again. Thank you.</p>
<p>[70:08] Thanks, Mr.</p>
<p>[70:11] Who</p>
