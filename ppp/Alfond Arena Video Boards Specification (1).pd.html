The words &#34;we&#34;, &#34;us&#34; and &#34;our&#34; refer to the company providing this insur-ance.

a. We will pay those sums that the insured be-comes legally obligated to pay as damages be-cause of &#34;bodily injury&#34; or &#34;property damage&#34; to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any &#34;suit&#34; seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any &#34;suit&#34; seeking damages for &#34;bodily injury&#34; or &#34;property damage&#34; to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any &#34;occurrence&#34; and settle any claim or &#34;suit&#34; that may result. But:
(1) The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in Section III – Limits Of Insurance; and
(2) Our right and duty to defend ends when we have used up the applicable limit of insur-ance in the payment of judgments or set-tlements under Coverages A or B or medical expenses under Coverage C.
No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless ex-plicitly provided for under Supplementary Pay-ments – Coverages A and B.

(1) The &#34;bodily injury&#34; or &#34;property damage&#34; is caused by an &#34;occurrence&#34; that takes place in the &#34;coverage territory&#34;;
(2) The &#34;bodily injury&#34; or &#34;property damage&#34; occurs during the policy period; and
(3) Prior to the policy period, no insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured and no &#34;employee&#34; authorized by you to give or receive notice of an &#34;occur-rence&#34; or claim, knew that the &#34;bodily injury&#34; or &#34;property damage&#34; had occurred, in whole or in part. If such a listed insured or author-ized &#34;employee&#34; knew, prior to the policy pe-riod, that the &#34;bodily injury&#34; or &#34;property damage&#34; occurred, then any continuation, change or resumption of such &#34;bodily injury&#34; or &#34;property damage&#34; during or after the pol-icy period will be deemed to have been known prior to the policy period.
c. &#34;Bodily injury&#34; or &#34;property damage&#34; which occurs during the policy period and was not, prior to the policy period, known to have oc-curred by any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured or any &#34;em-ployee&#34; authorized by you to give or receive no-tice of an &#34;occurrence&#34; or claim, includes any continuation, change or resumption of that &#34;bodily injury&#34; or &#34;property damage&#34; after the end of the policy period.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 2.b.(2) of Section I – Coverage A – Bodily Injury And Property Damage Liability, such payments will not be deemed to be damages for &#34;bodily injury&#34; and &#34;property damage&#34; and will not reduce the limits of insurance. Our obligation to defend an insured&#39;s indemnitee and to pay for attorneys&#39; fees and necessary litiga-tion expenses as Supplementary Payments ends when: a.

ance in the payment of judgments or settle-ments; or

In that case, the additional period will be deemed part of the last preceding period for purposes of determining the Limits of Insurance. SECTION IV – COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY CONDITIONS 1. Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the insured&#39;s estate will not relieve us of our obligations under this Coverage Part.
2. Duties In The Event Of Occurrence, Offense, Claim Or Suit a. You must see to it that we are notified as soon
as practicable of an &#34;occurrence&#34; or an offense which may result in a claim. To the extent pos-sible, notice should include:

(2) The names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses; and

(2) Authorize us to obtain records and other information;

d. No insured will, except at that insured&#39;s own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent.
3. Legal Action Against Us No person or organization has a right under this Coverage Part: a. To join us as a party or otherwise bring us into a
&#34;suit&#34; asking for damages from an insured; or</p>
<h3 id="sam-pl-2">Sam pl</h3>
<p>Alfond Arena Video Boards 00 62 16.11 - 10 Certificate of Insurance Form CG 00 01 12 04
b. To sue us on this Coverage Part unless all of its terms have been fully complied with.
A person or organization may sue us to recover on an agreed settlement or on a final judgment against an insured; but we will not be liable for damages that are not payable under the terms of this Coverage Part or that are in excess of the ap-plicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement means a settlement and release of liability signed by us, the insured and the claimant or the claim-ant&#39;s legal representative.
4. Other Insurance If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under Coverages A or B of this Coverage Part, our obligations are limited as follows: a. Primary Insurance
This insurance is primary except when b. below applies. If this insurance is primary, our obliga-tions are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all that other insurance by the method de-scribed in c. below.
b. Excess Insurance This insurance is excess over:
(1) Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis:
(a) That is Fire, Extended Coverage, Builder&#39;s Risk, Installation Risk or similar coverage for &#34;your work&#34;;
(b) That is Fire insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner;
(c) That is insurance purchased by you to cover your liability as a tenant for &#34;prop-erty damage&#34; to premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; or
(d) If the loss arises out of the maintenance or use of aircraft, &#34;autos&#34; or watercraft to the extent not subject to Exclusion g. of Section I – Coverage A – Bodily Injury And Property Damage Liability.
(2) Any other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations, or the products and completed operations, for which you have been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.
When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the in-sured against any &#34;suit&#34; if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that &#34;suit&#34;. If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the insured&#39;s rights against all those other insurers. When this insurance is excess over other insur-ance, we will pay only our share of the amount of the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of:
(1) The total amount that all such other insur-ance would pay for the loss in the absence of this insurance; and
(2) The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance.
We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part.
c. Method Of Sharing If all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first. If any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute by limits. Under this method, each insurer&#39;s share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of in-surance of all insurers.
5. Premium Audit a. We will compute all premiums for this Coverage
Part in accordance with our rules and rates. b. Premium shown in this Coverage Part as ad-
vance premium is a deposit premium only. At the close of each audit period we will compute the earned premium for that period and send notice to the first Named Insured. The due date for audit and retrospective premiums is the date shown as the due date on the bill. If the sum of the advance and audit premiums paid for the policy period is greater than the earned pre-mium, we will return the excess to the first Named Insured.
c. The first Named Insured must keep records of the information we need for premium computa-tion, and send us copies at such times as we may request.</p>

tions you made to us; and c. We have issued this policy in reliance upon
your representations. 7. Separation Of Insureds
Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this Coverage Part to the first Named Insured, this in-surance applies: a. As if each Named Insured were the only Named
Insured; and b. Separately to each insured against whom claim
is made or &#34;suit&#34; is brought. 8. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others
To Us If the insured has rights to recover all or part of any payment we have made under this Coverage Part, those rights are transferred to us. The insured must do nothing after loss to impair them. At our request, the insured will bring &#34;suit&#34; or transfer those rights to us and help us enforce them.
9. When We Do Not Renew If we decide not to renew this Coverage Part, we will mail or deliver to the first Named Insured shown in the Declarations written notice of the non-renewal not less than 30 days before the expiration date.

POLICY NUMBER: COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY CG 25 04 03 97
THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY.  PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</p>
<h5 id="designated-location-s-general-aggregate-limit">DESIGNATED LOCATION(S) GENERAL AGGREGATE LIMIT</h5>
<p>This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:
COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART
SCHEDULE
Designated Location(s):
(If no entry appears above, information required to complete this endorsement will be shown in  the Declarations as applicable to this endorsement.)
A. For all sums which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages caused by “occurrences” under COVERAGE A (SECTION I), and for all medical expenses caused by acci-dents under COVERAGE C (SECTION I), which can be attributed only to operations at a single designated “location” shown in the Schedule above:</p>
<ol>
<li>A separate Designated Location General Aggregate Limit applies to each designated “location”, and that limit is equal to the amount of the General Aggregate Limit shown in the Declarations.</li>
<li>The Designated Location General Aggregate Limit is the most we will pay for the sum of all damages under COVERAGE A, except dam-ages because of “bodily injury” or “property damage” included in the “products-completed operations hazard”, and for medical expenses under COVERAGE C regardless of the num-ber of:
a. Insureds;
b. Claims made or “suits” brought; or
c. Persons or organizations making claims or bringing “suits”.</li>
<li>Any payments made under COVERAGE A for damages or under COVERAGE C for medical expenses shall reduce the Desig-nated Location General Aggregate Limit for that designated “location”. Such payments shall not reduce the General Aggregate Limit shown in the Declarations nor shall they re-duce any other Designated Location General Aggregate Limit for any other designated “location” shown in the Schedule above.</li>
<li>The limits shown in the Declarations for Each Occurrence, Fire Damage and Medical Ex-pense continue to apply. However, instead of being subject to the General Aggregate Limit shown in the Declarations, such limits will be subject to the applicable Designated Location General Aggregate Limit.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sam-ple-5">Sam ple</h3>
<p>B. For all sums which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages caused by “occurrences” under COVERAGE A (SECTION I), and for all medical expenses caused by acci-dents under COVERAGE C (SECTION I), which cannot be attributed only to operations at a sin-gle designated “location” shown in the Schedule above:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any payments made under COVERAGE A for damages or under COVERAGE C for medical expenses shall reduce the amount available under the General Aggregate Limit or the Products-Completed Operations Ag-gregate Limit, whichever is applicable; and</li>
<li>Such payments shall not reduce any Designated Location General Aggregate Limit.
C. When coverage for liability arising out of the “products-completed operations hazard” is pro-vided, any payments for damages because of “bodily injury” or “property damage” included in the “products-completed operations hazard” will reduce the Products-Completed Operations Ag-gregate Limit, and not reduce the General Ag-gregate Limit nor the Designated Location Gen-eral Aggregate Limit.
D. For the purposes of this endorsement, the Defi-nitions Section is amended by the addition of the following definition:
“Location” means premises involving the same or connecting lots, or premises whose connec-tion is interrupted only by a street, roadway, wa-terway or right-of-way of a railroad.
E. The provisions of Limits Of Insurance (SECTION III) not otherwise modified by this endorsement shall continue to apply as stipulated.</li>

ARTICLE 1   GENERAL PROVISIONS § 1.1 Basic Definitions § 1.1.1 The Contract Documents The Contract Documents are enumerated in the Agreement between the Owner and Contractor (hereinafter the Agreement) and consist of the Agreement, Conditions of the Contract (General, Supplementary and other Conditions), Drawings, Specifications, Addenda issued prior to execution of the Contract, other documents listed in the Agreement, and Modifications issued after execution of the Contract. A Modification is (1) a written amendment to the Contract signed by both parties, (2) a Change Order, (3) a Construction Change Directive, or (4) a written order for a minor change in the Work issued by the Architect. Unless specifically enumerated in the Agreement, the Contract Documents do not include the advertisement or invitation to bid, Instructions to Bidders, sample forms, other information furnished by the Owner in anticipation of receiving bids or proposals, the Contractor’s bid or proposal, or portions of Addenda relating to bidding or proposal requirements.
§ 1.1.2 The Contract The Contract Documents form the Contract for Construction. The Contract represents the entire and integrated agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, either written or oral. The Contract may be amended or modified only by a Modification. The Contract Documents shall not be construed to create a contractual relationship of any kind (1) between the Contractor and the Architect or the Architect’s consultants, (2) between the Owner and a Subcontractor or a Sub-subcontractor, (3) between the Owner and the Architect or the Architect’s consultants, or (4) between any persons or entities other than the Owner and the Contractor. The Architect shall, however, be entitled to performance and enforcement of obligations under the Contract intended to facilitate performance of the Architect’s duties.
§ 1.1.3 The Work The term &#34;Work&#34; means the construction and services required by the Contract Documents, whether completed or partially completed, and includes all other labor, materials, equipment, and services provided or to be provided by the Contractor to fulfill the Contractor’s obligations. The Work may constitute the whole or a part of the Project.
§ 1.1.4 The Project The Project is the total construction of which the Work performed under the Contract Documents may be the whole or a part and which may include construction by the Owner and by Separate Contractors.
§ 1.1.5 The Drawings The Drawings are the graphic and pictorial portions of the Contract Documents showing the design, location and dimensions of the Work, generally including plans, elevations, sections, details, schedules, and diagrams.
§ 1.1.6 The Specifications The Specifications are that portion of the Contract Documents consisting of the written requirements for materials, equipment, systems, standards and workmanship for the Work, and performance of related services.
§ 1.1.7 Instruments of Service Instruments of Service are representations, in any medium of expression now known or later developed, of the tangible and intangible creative work performed by the Architect and the Architect’s consultants under their respective professional services agreements. Instruments of Service may include, without limitation, studies, surveys, models, sketches, drawings, specifications, and other similar materials.
§ 1.1.8 Initial Decision Maker The Initial Decision Maker is the person identified in the Agreement to render initial decisions on Claims in accordance with Section 15.2. The Initial Decision Maker shall not show partiality to the Owner or Contractor and shall not be liable for results of interpretations or decisions rendered in good faith. The Architect is the Initial Decision Maker for this Agreement.
§ 1.2 Correlation and Intent of the Contract Documents § 1.2.1 The intent of the Contract Documents is to include all items necessary for the proper execution and completion of the Work by the Contractor. The Contract Documents are complementary, and what is required by one shall be as binding as if required by all; performance by the Contractor shall be required only to the extent consistent with the Contract Documents and reasonably inferable from them as being necessary to produce the indicated results.

§ 1.2.1.1 The invalidity of any provision of the Contract Documents shall not invalidate the Contract or its remaining provisions. If it is determined that any provision of the Contract Documents violates any law, or is otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then that provision shall be revised to the extent necessary to make that provision legal and enforceable. In such case the Contract Documents shall be construed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to give effect to the parties’ intentions and purposes in executing the Contract.
§ 1.2.2 Organization of the Specifications into divisions, sections and articles, and arrangement of Drawings shall not control the Contractor in dividing the Work among Subcontractors or in establishing the extent of Work to be performed by any trade. Where the Procurement Requirements include provisions that portions of the Work be File Bid in accordance with the requirements of the Maine Bid Depository System, the subcontracts for these portions of the work will cover the same scope of work as defined by the Procurement Requirements and the File Bid and shall have the same contract amount as listed in the successful bid.
§ 1.2.3 Unless otherwise stated in the Contract Documents, words that have well-known technical or construction industry meanings are used in the Contract Documents in accordance with such recognized meanings.
§ 1.3 Capitalization Terms capitalized in these General Conditions include those that are (1) specifically defined, (2) the titles of numbered articles, or (3) the titles of other documents published by the American Institute of Architects.
§ 1.4 Interpretation In the interest of brevity the Contract Documents frequently omit modifying words such as &#34;all&#34; and &#34;any&#34; and articles such as &#34;the&#34; and &#34;an,&#34; but the fact that a modifier or an article is absent from one statement and appears in another is not intended to affect the interpretation of either statement.
§ 1.5 Ownership and Use of Drawings, Specifications, and Other Instruments of Service § 1.5.1 The Architect and the Architect’s consultants shall be deemed the authors and owners of their respective Instruments of Service, including the Drawings and Specifications, and retain all common law, statutory, and other reserved rights in their Instruments of Service, including copyrights. The Contractor, Subcontractors, Sub-subcontractors, and suppliers shall not own or claim a copyright in the Instruments of Service. Submittal or distribution to meet official regulatory requirements or for other purposes in connection with the Project is not to be construed as publication in derogation of the Architect’s or Architect’s consultants’ reserved rights.  The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to modify the contract between the University of Maine System (the Owner) and the Architect under B102-2017 and B201-2017.
§ 1.5.2 The Contractor, Subcontractors, Sub-subcontractors, and suppliers are authorized to use and reproduce the Instruments of Service provided to them, subject to any protocols established pursuant to Sections 1.7 and 1.8, solely and exclusively for execution of the Work. All copies made under this authorization shall bear the copyright notice, if any, shown on the Instruments of Service. The Contractor, Subcontractors, Sub-subcontractors, and suppliers may not use the Instruments of Service on other projects or for additions to the Project outside the scope of the Work without the specific written consent of the Owner, Architect, and the Architect’s consultants.  The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to modify the contract between the University of Maine System (the Owner) and the Architect under B102-2017 and B201-2017.
§ 1.6 Notice § 1.6.1 Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.6.2, where the Contract Documents require one party to notify or give notice to the other party, such notice shall be provided in writing to the designated representative of the party to whom the notice is addressed and shall be deemed to have been duly served if delivered in person, by mail, by courier, or by electronic transmission if a method for electronic transmission is set forth in the Agreement.
§ 1.6.2 Notice of Claims as provided in Section 15.1.3 shall be provided in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly served only if delivered to the designated representative of the party to whom the notice is addressed by certified or registered mail, or by courier providing proof of delivery.

§ 3.12.8 The Work shall be in accordance with approved submittals except that the Contractor shall not be relieved of responsibility for deviations from the requirements of the Contract Documents by the Architect’s approval of Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples, or similar submittals, unless the Contractor has specifically notified the Architect of such deviation at the time of submittal and (1) the Architect has given written approval to the specific deviation as a minor change in the Work, or (2) a Change Order or Construction Change Directive has been issued authorizing the deviation. The Contractor shall not be relieved of responsibility for errors or omissions in Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples, or similar submittals, by the Architect’s approval thereof.
§ 3.12.9 The Contractor shall direct specific attention, in writing or on resubmitted Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples, or similar submittals, to revisions other than those requested by the Architect on previous submittals. In the absence of such notice, the Architect’s approval of a resubmission shall not apply to such revisions.

.1 The Contractor shall reimburse the Owner for compensation paid to the Architect for additional site visits made necessary by the fault, neglect as determined solely by the Owner, or request of the Contractor.  The reimbursement shall be deducted from the next payment made from the Contract Sum following the Owner’s payment to the Architect.
§ 4.2.3 On the basis of the site visits, the Architect will keep the Owner reasonably informed about the progress and quality of the portion of the Work completed, and promptly report to the Owner (1) known deviations from the Contract Documents, (2) known deviations from the most recent construction schedule submitted by the Contractor, and (3) defects and deficiencies observed in the Work. The Architect will not be responsible for the Contractor’s failure to perform the Work in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents.

However, neither this authority of the Architect nor a decision made in good faith either to exercise or not to exercise such authority shall give rise to a duty or responsibility of the Architect to the Contractor, Subcontractors, suppliers, their agents or employees, or other persons or entities performing portions of the Work.
§ 4.2.7 The Architect will review and approve, or take other appropriate action upon, the Contractor’s submittals such as Shop Drawings, Product Data, and Samples, but only for the limited purpose of checking for conformance with information given and the design concept expressed in the Contract Documents. The Architect’s action will be taken in accordance with the submittal schedule approved by the Architect or, in the absence of an approved submittal schedule, with reasonable promptness while allowing sufficient time in the Architect’s professional judgment to permit adequate review. Review of such submittals is not conducted for the purpose of determining the accuracy and completeness of other details such as dimensions and quantities, or for substantiating instructions for installation or performance of equipment or systems, all of which remain the responsibility of the Contractor as required by the Contract Documents. The Architect’s review of the Contractor’s submittals shall not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under Sections 3.3, 3.5, and 3.12. The Architect’s review shall not constitute approval of safety precautions or of any construction means, methods, techniques, sequences, or procedures. The Architect’s approval of a specific item shall not indicate approval of an assembly of which the item is a component.
§ 4.2.8 The Architect will prepare Change Orders and Construction Change Directives, and may order minor changes in the Work as provided in Section 7.4.

§ 5.2 Award of Subcontracts and Other Contracts for Portions of the Work § 5.2.1 Unless otherwise stated in the Contract Documents, the Contractor, as soon as practicable after award of the Contract, shall notify the Owner and Architect of the persons or entities proposed for each principal portion of the Work, including those who are to furnish materials or equipment fabricated to a special design. Within 14 days of receipt of the information, the Architect may notify the Contractor whether the Owner or the Architect (1) has reasonable objection to any such proposed person or entity or (2) requires additional time for review. Failure of the Architect to provide notice within the 14-day period shall constitute notice of no reasonable objection.
.1 The Contractor shall provide Owner a list of all subcontractors and independent contractors on the job site and a record of the entity to whom that subcontractor or independent contractor is directly contracted and by whom that subcontractor or independent contractor is insured for workers’ compensation purposes.  The list shall be presented at the preconstruction meeting and, when changes occur, at each requisition meeting as necessary.

§ 5.3 Subcontractual Relations By appropriate written agreement, the Contractor shall require each Subcontractor, to the extent of the Work to be performed by the Subcontractor, to be bound to the Contractor by terms of the Contract Documents, and to assume toward the Contractor all the obligations and responsibilities, including the responsibility for safety of the Subcontractor’s Work that the Contractor, by these Contract Documents, assumes toward the Owner and Architect. Each subcontract agreement shall preserve and protect the rights of the Owner and Architect under the Contract Documents with respect to the Work to be performed by the Subcontractor so that subcontracting thereof will not prejudice such rights, and shall allow to the Subcontractor, unless specifically provided otherwise in the subcontract agreement, the benefit of all rights, remedies, and redress against the Contractor that the Contractor, by the Contract Documents, has against the Owner. Where appropriate, the Contractor shall require each Subcontractor to enter into similar agreements with Sub-subcontractors.

Subcontractors will similarly make copies of applicable portions of such documents available to their respective proposed Sub-subcontractors.
§ 5.4 Contingent Assignment of Subcontracts § 5.4.1 Each subcontract agreement for a portion of the Work is assigned by the Contractor to the Owner, provided that
.1 assignment is effective only after termination of the Contract by the Owner for cause pursuant to Section 14.2 and only for those subcontract agreements that the Owner accepts by notifying the Subcontractor and Contractor; and
.2 assignment is subject to the prior rights of the surety, if any, obligated under bond relating to the Contract.
When the Owner accepts the assignment of a subcontract agreement, the Owner assumes the Contractor’s rights and obligations under the subcontract.
§ 5.4.2 Upon such assignment, if the Work has been suspended for more than 30 days, the Subcontractor’s compensation shall be equitably adjusted for increases in cost resulting from the suspension.
§ 5.4.3 Upon assignment to the Owner under this Section 5.4, the Owner may further assign the subcontract to a successor contractor or other entity.

Failure of the Contractor to notify the Architect of apparent discrepancies or defects prior to proceeding with the Work shall constitute an acknowledgment that the Owner’s or Separate Contractor’s completed or partially completed construction is fit and proper to receive the Contractor’s Work. The Contractor shall not be responsible for discrepancies or defects in the construction or operations by the Owner or Separate Contractor that are not apparent.
§ 6.2.3 The Contractor shall reimburse the Owner for costs the Owner incurs that are payable to a Separate Contractor because of the Contractor’s delays, improperly timed activities or defective construction.

An order for a minor change in the Work may be issued by the Architect alone.
§ 7.1.3 Changes in the Work shall be performed under applicable provisions of the Contract Documents. The Contractor shall proceed promptly with changes in the Work, unless otherwise provided in the Change Order, Construction Change Directive, or order for a minor change in the Work.

§ 7.1.6 In order to facilitate checking of quotations, all proposals, except those so minor that their propriety can be seen by inspection, shall be accompanied by complete itemization of costs including labor, materials and Subcontracts. Labor and materials shall be itemized in the manner prescribed above.  Where major cost items are Subcontracts, they are to be itemized also.  In no case will a change be approved without such itemization.
§ 7.2 Change Orders § 7.2.1 A Change Order is a written instrument prepared by the Architect and signed by the Owner, Contractor, and Architect stating their agreement upon all of the following:
.1 The change in the Work;
.2 The amount of the adjustment, if any, in the Contract Sum; and
.3 The extent of the adjustment, if any, in the Contract Time.
§ 7.3 Construction Change Directives § 7.3.1 A Construction Change Directive is a written order prepared by the Architect and signed by the Owner and Architect, directing a change in the Work prior to agreement on adjustment, if any, in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, or both. The Owner may by Construction Change Directive, without invalidating the Contract, order changes in the Work within the general scope of the Contract consisting of additions, deletions, or other revisions, the Contract Sum and Contract Time being adjusted accordingly.
§ 7.3.2 A Construction Change Directive shall be used in the absence of total agreement on the terms of a Change Order.
§ 7.3.3 If the Construction Change Directive provides for an adjustment to the Contract Sum, the adjustment shall be based on one of the following methods:
.1 Mutual acceptance of a lump sum properly itemized and supported by sufficient substantiating data to permit evaluation;
.2 Unit prices stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently agreed upon;
.3 Cost to be determined in a manner agreed upon by the parties and a mutually acceptable fixed or percentage fee; or
.4 As provided in Section 7.3.4.
§ 7.3.4 If the Contractor does not respond promptly or disagrees with the method for adjustment in the Contract Sum, the Architect shall determine the adjustment on the basis of reasonable expenditures and savings of those performing the Work attributable to the change, including, in case of an increase in the Contract Sum, an amount for overhead and profit as set forth in the Agreement, or if no such amount is set forth in the Agreement, a reasonable amount. In such case, and also under Section 7.3.3.3, the Contractor shall keep and present, in such form as the Architect may prescribe, an itemized accounting together with appropriate supporting data. Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, costs for the purposes of this Section 7.3.4 shall be limited to the following:

.3 Rental costs of machinery and equipment, exclusive of hand tools, whether rented from the Contractor or others;
.4 Costs of premiums for all bonds and insurance, permit fees, and sales, use, or similar taxes, directly related to the change; and
.5 Costs of supervision and field office personnel directly attributable to the change.
§ 7.3.5 If the Contractor disagrees with the adjustment in the Contract Time, the Contractor may make a Claim in accordance with applicable provisions of Article 15.
§ 7.3.6 Upon receipt of a Construction Change Directive, the Contractor shall promptly proceed with the change in the Work involved and advise the Architect of the Contractor’s agreement or disagreement with the method, if any, provided in the Construction Change Directive for determining the proposed adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time.
§ 7.3.7 A Construction Change Directive signed by the Contractor indicates the Contractor’s agreement therewith, including adjustment in Contract Sum and Contract Time or the method for determining them. Such agreement shall be effective immediately and shall be recorded as a Change Order.
§ 7.3.8 The amount of credit to be allowed by the Contractor to the Owner for a deletion or change that results in a net decrease in the Contract Sum shall be actual net cost as confirmed by the Architect. When both additions and credits covering related Work or substitutions are involved in a change, the allowance for overhead and profit shall be figured on the basis of net increase, if any, with respect to that change.
§ 7.3.9 Pending final determination of the total cost of a Construction Change Directive to the Owner, the Contractor may request payment for Work completed under the Construction Change Directive in Applications for Payment. The Architect will make an interim determination for purposes of monthly certification for payment for those costs and certify for payment the amount that the Architect determines, in the Architect’s professional judgment, to be reasonably justified. The Architect’s interim determination of cost shall adjust the Contract Sum on the same basis as a Change Order, subject to the right of either party to disagree and assert a Claim in accordance with Article 15.
§ 7.3.10 When the Owner and Contractor agree with a determination made by the Architect concerning the adjustments in the Contract Sum and Contract Time, or otherwise reach agreement upon the adjustments, such agreement shall be effective immediately and the Architect will prepare a Change Order. Change Orders may be issued for all or any part of a Construction Change Directive.
§ 7.4 Minor Changes in the Work The Architect may order minor changes in the Work that are consistent with the intent of the Contract Documents and do not involve an adjustment in the Contract Sum or an extension of the Contract Time. The Architect’s order for minor changes shall be in writing. If the Contractor believes that the proposed minor change in the Work will affect the Contract Sum or Contract Time, the Contractor shall notify the Architect and shall not proceed to implement the change in the Work. If the Contractor performs the Work set forth in the Architect’s order for a minor change without prior notice to the Architect that such change will affect the Contract Sum or Contract Time, the Contractor waives any adjustment to the Contract Sum or extension of the Contract Time.
ARTICLE 8   TIME § 8.1 Definitions § 8.1.1 Unless otherwise provided, Contract Time is the period of time, including authorized adjustments, allotted in the Contract Documents for Substantial Completion of the Work.
§ 8.1.2 The date of commencement of the Work is the date established in the Agreement.
§ 8.1.3 The date of Substantial Completion is the date certified by the Architect in accordance with Section 9.8.
§ 8.1.4 The term &#34;day&#34; as used in the Contract Documents shall mean calendar day unless otherwise specifically defined.

§ 8.2.3 The Contractor shall proceed expeditiously with adequate forces and shall achieve Substantial Completion within the Contract Time.
§ 8.3 Delays and Extensions of Time § 8.3.1 If the Contractor is delayed at any time in the commencement or progress of the Work by (1) an act or neglect of the Owner or Architect, of an employee of either, or of a Separate Contractor; (2) by changes ordered in the Work; (3) by labor disputes, fire, unusual delay in deliveries, unavoidable casualties, adverse weather conditions documented in accordance with Section 15.1.6.2, or other causes beyond the Contractor’s control; (4) by delay authorized by the Owner pending mediation and binding dispute resolution; or (5) by other causes that the Contractor asserts, and the Architect determines, justify delay, then the Contract Time shall be extended for such reasonable time as the Architect may determine.
§ 8.3.2 Claims relating to time shall be made in accordance with applicable provisions of Article 15.
§ 8.3.3 This Section 8.3 does not preclude recovery of damages for delay by either party under other provisions of the Contract Documents.
ARTICLE 9   PAYMENTS AND COMPLETION § 9.1 Contract Sum § 9.1.1 The Contract Sum is stated in the Agreement and, including authorized adjustments, is the total amount payable by the Owner to the Contractor for performance of the Work under the Contract Documents.
§ 9.1.2 If unit prices are stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently agreed upon, and if quantities originally contemplated are materially changed so that application of such unit prices to the actual quantities causes substantial inequity to the Owner or Contractor, the applicable unit prices shall be equitably adjusted.
§ 9.2 Schedule of Values Where the Contract is based on a stipulated sum or Guaranteed Maximum Price, the Contractor shall submit a schedule of values to the Architect before the first Application for Payment, allocating the entire Contract Sum to the various portions of the Work. The schedule of values shall be prepared in the form, and supported by the data to substantiate its accuracy, required by the Architect. This schedule, unless objected to by the Architect, shall be used as a basis for reviewing the Contractor’s Applications for Payment. Any changes to the schedule of values shall be submitted to the Architect and supported by such data to substantiate its accuracy as the Architect may require, and unless objected to by the Architect, shall be used as a basis for reviewing the Contractor’s subsequent Applications for Payment.
§ 9.3 Applications for Payment § 9.3.1 At least ten days before the date established for each progress payment, the Contractor shall submit to the Architect an itemized Application for Payment prepared in accordance with the schedule of values, if required under Section 9.2, for completed portions of the Work. The application shall be notarized, if required, and supported by all data substantiating the Contractor’s right to payment that the Owner or Architect require, such as copies of requisitions, and releases and waivers of liens from Subcontractors and suppliers, and shall reflect retainage if provided for in the Contract Documents.
§ 9.3.1.1 As provided in Section 7.3.9, such applications may include requests for payment on account of changes in the Work that have been properly authorized by Construction Change Directives, or by interim determinations of the Architect, but not yet included in Change Orders.

§ 9.3.1.2 Applications for Payment shall not include requests for payment for portions of the Work for which the Contractor does not intend to pay a Subcontractor or supplier, unless such Work has been performed by others whom the Contractor intends to pay.
§ 9.3.1.3 The provisions of Title 5 M.R.S.A § 1746, as amended, pertain to this project.  The Owner shall retain five percent (5%) of each payment due the Contractor as part of the security for the fulfillment of the Contract Agreement by the Contractor; the Contractor shall not withhold a greater percentage from subcontractors.  The Owner may, if deemed expedient by the Owner, cause the Contractor to be paid temporarily or permanently from time to time during the progress of the work, such portion of the amount retained as the Owner deems prudent or desirable.
§ 9.3.2 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, payments shall be made on account of materials and equipment delivered and suitably stored at the site for subsequent incorporation in the Work. If approved in advance by the Owner, payment may similarly be made for materials and equipment suitably stored off the site at a location agreed upon in writing. Payment for materials and equipment stored on or off the site shall be conditioned upon compliance by the Contractor with procedures satisfactory to the Owner to establish the Owner’s title to such materials and equipment or otherwise protect the Owner’s interest, and shall include the costs of applicable insurance, storage, and transportation to the site, for such materials and equipment stored off the site.
§ 9.3.3 The Contractor warrants that title to all Work covered by an Application for Payment will pass to the Owner no later than the time of payment. The Contractor further warrants that upon submittal of an Application for Payment all Work for which Certificates for Payment have been previously issued and payments received from the Owner shall, to the best of the Contractor’s knowledge, information, and belief, be free and clear of liens, claims, security interests, or encumbrances, in favor of the Contractor, Subcontractors, suppliers, or other persons or entities that provided labor, materials, and equipment relating to the Work.
§ 9.4 Certificates for Payment § 9.4.1 The Architect will, within seven days after receipt of the Contractor’s Application for Payment, either (1) issue to the Owner a Certificate for Payment in the full amount of the Application for Payment, with a copy to the Contractor; or (2) issue to the Owner a Certificate for Payment for such amount as the Architect determines is properly due, and notify the Contractor and Owner of the Architect’s reasons for withholding certification in part as provided in Section 9.5.1; or (3) withhold certification of the entire Application for Payment, and notify the Contractor and Owner of the Architect’s reason for withholding certification in whole as provided in Section 9.5.1.
§ 9.4.2 The issuance of a Certificate for Payment will constitute a representation by the Architect to the Owner, based on the Architect’s evaluation of the Work and the data in the Application for Payment, that, to the best of the Architect’s knowledge, information, and belief, the Work has progressed to the point indicated, the quality of the Work is in accordance with the Contract Documents, and that the Contractor is entitled to payment in the amount certified. The foregoing representations are subject to an evaluation of the Work for conformance with the Contract Documents upon Substantial Completion, to results of subsequent tests and inspections, to correction of minor deviations from the Contract Documents prior to completion, and to specific qualifications expressed by the Architect. However, the issuance of a Certificate for Payment will not be a representation that the Architect has (1) made exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or quantity of the Work; (2) reviewed construction means, methods, techniques, sequences, or procedures; (3) reviewed copies of requisitions received from Subcontractors and suppliers and other data requested by the Owner to substantiate the Contractor’s right to payment; or (4) made examination to ascertain how or for what purpose the Contractor has used money previously paid on account of the Contract Sum.
§ 9.5 Decisions to Withhold Certification § 9.5.1 The Architect may shall withhold a Certificate for Payment in whole or in part, to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the Owner, if in the Architect’s opinion the representations to the Owner required by Section 9.4.2 cannot be made. If the Architect is unable to certify payment in the amount of the Application, the Architect will notify the Contractor and Owner as provided in Section 9.4.1. If the Contractor and Architect cannot agree on a revised amount, the Architect will promptly issue a Certificate for Payment for the amount for which the Architect is able to make such representations to the Owner. The Architect may shall also withhold a Certificate for Payment or, because of subsequently discovered evidence, may shall nullify the whole or a part of a Certificate for Payment previously issued, to such extent as may be necessary in the Architect’s opinion to protect the Owner from loss for which the Contractor is responsible, including loss resulting from acts and omissions described in Section 3.3.2, because of

§ 9.5.2 When either party disputes the Architect’s decision regarding a Certificate for Payment under Section 9.5.1, in whole or in part, that party may submit a Claim in accordance with Article 15.
§ 9.5.3 When the reasons for withholding certification are removed, certification will be made for amounts previously withheld.
§ 9.5.4 If the Architect withholds certification for payment under Section 9.5.1.3, the Owner may, at its sole option, issue joint checks to the Contractor and to any Subcontractor or supplier to whom the Contractor failed to make payment for Work properly performed or material or equipment suitably delivered. If the Owner makes payments by joint check, the Owner shall notify the Architect and the Contractor shall reflect such payment on its next Application for Payment.
§ 9.6 Progress Payments § 9.6.1 After the Architect has issued a Certificate for Payment, the Owner shall make payment in the manner and within the time provided in the Contract Documents, and shall so notify the Architect.
§ 9.6.2 The Contractor shall pay each Subcontractor, no later than seven days after receipt of payment from the Owner, the amount to which the Subcontractor is entitled, reflecting percentages actually retained from payments to the Contractor on account of the Subcontractor’s portion of the Work. The Contractor shall, by appropriate agreement with each Subcontractor, require each Subcontractor to make payments to Sub-subcontractors in a similar manner.
§ 9.6.3 The Architect will, on request, furnish to a Subcontractor, if practicable, information regarding percentages of completion or amounts applied for by the Contractor and action taken thereon by the Architect and Owner on account of portions of the Work done by such Subcontractor.
§ 9.6.4 The Owner has the right to request written evidence from the Contractor that the Contractor has properly paid Subcontractors and suppliers amounts paid by the Owner to the Contractor for subcontracted Work. If the Contractor fails to furnish such evidence within seven days, the Owner shall have the right to contact Subcontractors and suppliers to ascertain whether they have been properly paid. Neither the Owner nor Architect shall have an obligation to pay, or to see to the payment of money to, a Subcontractor or supplier, except as may otherwise be required by law.
§ 9.6.5 The Contractor’s payments to suppliers shall be treated in a manner similar to that provided in Sections 9.6.2, 9.6.3 and 9.6.4.
§ 9.6.6 A Certificate for Payment, a progress payment, or partial or entire use or occupancy of the Project by the Owner shall not constitute acceptance of Work not in accordance with the Contract Documents.
§ 9.6.7 Unless the Contractor provides the Owner with a payment bond in the full penal sum of the Contract Sum, payments received by the Contractor for Work properly performed by Subcontractors or provided by suppliers shall be held by the Contractor for those Subcontractors or suppliers who performed Work or furnished materials, or both, under contract with the Contractor for which payment was made by the Owner. Nothing contained herein shall require money to be placed in a separate account and not commingled with money of the Contractor, create any fiduciary

liability or tort liability on the part of the Contractor for breach of trust, or entitle any person or entity to an award of punitive damages against the Contractor for breach of the requirements of this provision.
§ 9.6.8 Provided the Owner has fulfilled its payment obligations under the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall defend and indemnify the Owner from all loss, liability, damage or expense, including reasonable attorney’s fees and litigation expenses, arising out of any lien claim or other claim for payment by any Subcontractor or supplier of any tier. Upon receipt of notice of a lien claim or other claim for payment, the Owner shall notify the Contractor. If approved by the applicable court, when required, the Contractor may substitute a surety bond for the property against which the lien or other claim for payment has been asserted.
§ 9.6.9 All Progress Payments and Final Payment are subject to the requirements of the &#34;Maine Prompt Pay Act&#34; Title 10 M.R.S.A. ch. 201-A, as amended.  Payments shall be made on a timely basis in accord with the requirements of this Statute; however, the Contractor waives interest on any late payment.
§ 9.7 Failure of Payment If the Architect does not issue a Certificate for Payment, through no fault of the Contractor, within seven days after receipt of the Contractor’s Application for Payment, or if the Owner does not pay the Contractor within seven days after the date established in the Contract Documents, the amount certified by the Architect or awarded by binding dispute resolution, then the Contractor may, upon seven additional days’ notice to the Owner and Architect, stop the Work until payment of the amount owing has been received. The Contract Time shall be extended appropriately and the Contract Sum shall be increased by the amount of the Contractor’s reasonable costs of shutdown, delay and start-up, plus interest as provided for in the Contract Documents.
§ 9.8 Substantial Completion § 9.8.1 Substantial Completion is the stage in the progress of the Work when the Work or designated portion thereof is sufficiently complete in accordance with the Contract Documents so that the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work for its intended use.
§ 9.8.2 When the Contractor considers that the Work, or a portion thereof which the Owner agrees to accept separately, is substantially complete, the Contractor shall prepare and submit to the Architect a comprehensive list of items to be completed or corrected prior to final payment. Failure to include an item on such list does not alter the responsibility of the Contractor to complete all Work in accordance with the Contract Documents.
§ 9.8.3 Upon receipt of the Contractor’s list, the Architect will make an inspection to determine whether the Work or designated portion thereof is substantially complete. If the Architect’s inspection discloses any item, whether or not included on the Contractor’s list, which is not sufficiently complete in accordance with the Contract Documents so that the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work or designated portion thereof for its intended use, the Contractor shall, before issuance of the Certificate of Substantial Completion, complete or correct such item upon notification by the Architect. In such case, the Contractor shall then submit a request for another inspection by the Architect to determine Substantial Completion.
§ 9.8.4 When the Work or designated portion thereof is substantially complete, the Architect will prepare a Certificate of Substantial Completion that shall establish the date of Substantial Completion; establish responsibilities of the Owner and Contractor for security, maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the Work and insurance; and fix the time within which the Contractor shall finish all items on the list accompanying the Certificate. Warranties required by the Contract Documents shall commence on the date of Substantial Completion of the Work or designated portion thereof unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Substantial Completion.
§ 9.8.5 The Certificate of Substantial Completion shall be submitted to the Owner and Contractor for their written acceptance of responsibilities assigned to them in the Certificate. Upon such acceptance, and consent of surety if any, the Owner shall make payment of retainage applying to the Work or designated portion thereof. Such payment shall be adjusted for Work that is incomplete or not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents.
§ 9.9 Partial Occupancy or Use § 9.9.1 The Owner may occupy or use any completed or partially completed portion of the Work at any stage when such portion is designated by separate agreement with the Contractor, provided such occupancy or use is consented to by the insurer and authorized by public authorities having jurisdiction over the Project. Such partial occupancy or use

may commence whether or not the portion is substantially complete, provided the Owner and Contractor have accepted in writing the responsibilities assigned to each of them for payments, retainage, if any, security, maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the Work and insurance, and have agreed in writing concerning the period for correction of the Work and commencement of warranties required by the Contract Documents. When the Contractor considers a portion substantially complete, the Contractor shall prepare and submit a list to the Architect as provided under Section 9.8.2. Consent of the Contractor to partial occupancy or use shall not be unreasonably withheld. The stage of the progress of the Work shall be determined by written agreement between the Owner and Contractor or, if no agreement is reached, by decision of the Architect.
§ 9.9.2 Immediately prior to such partial occupancy or use, the Owner, Contractor, and Architect shall jointly inspect the area to be occupied or portion of the Work to be used in order to determine and record the condition of the Work.
§ 9.9.3 Unless otherwise agreed upon, partial occupancy or use of a portion or portions of the Work shall not constitute acceptance of Work not complying with the requirements of the Contract Documents.
§ 9.10 Final Completion and Final Payment § 9.10.1 Upon receipt of the Contractor’s notice that the Work is ready for final inspection and acceptance and upon receipt of a final Application for Payment, the Architect will promptly make such inspection. When the Architect finds the Work acceptable under the Contract Documents and the Contract fully performed, the Architect will promptly issue a final Certificate for Payment stating that to the best of the Architect’s knowledge, information and belief, and on the basis of the Architect’s on-site visits and inspections, the Work has been completed in accordance with the Contract Documents and that the entire balance found to be due the Contractor and noted in the final Certificate is due and payable. The Architect’s final Certificate for Payment will constitute a further representation that conditions listed in Section 9.10.2 as precedent to the Contractor’s being entitled to final payment have been fulfilled.
.1 Except with the consent of the Owner, the Architect will perform no more than three (3) site reviews to determine whether the Work or a designated portion thereof has attained Final Completion in accordance with the Contract Documents.  The Owner shall be entitled to deduct from the Contract Sum amounts paid to the Architect for any additional site reviews.
§ 9.10.2 Neither final payment nor any remaining retained percentage shall become due until the Contractor submits to the Architect (1) an affidavit that payrolls, bills for materials and equipment, and other indebtedness connected with the Work for which the Owner or the Owner’s property might be responsible or encumbered (less amounts withheld by Owner) have been paid or otherwise satisfied, (2) a certificate evidencing that insurance required by the Contract Documents to remain in force after final payment is currently in effect, (3) a written statement that the Contractor knows of no reason that the insurance will not be renewable to cover the period required by the Contract Documents, (4) consent of surety, if any, to final payment, (5) documentation of any special warranties, such as manufacturers’ warranties or specific Subcontractor warranties, and (6) if required by the Owner, other data establishing payment or satisfaction of obligations, such as receipts and releases and waivers of liens, claims, security interests, or encumbrances arising out of the Contract, to the extent and in such form as may be designated by the Owner.

SCHEDULE OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
Liquidated damages (a fixed amount set forth in the Contract) agreed to by the Owner and the Contractor are intended to compensate the Owner for unexcused delay in the performance of the Contract.  The parties agree that the purpose of the liquidated damages schedule below is to establish, in advance, a reasonable estimate of the damages that would be incurred by the Owner if there is an unexcused delay, or a breach of Contract, which causes the work to be extended beyond the contractual substantial completion date.  This agreement of liquidated damages by the parties is made to establish the reasonableness of them to the actual damages an Owner may have incurred due to unexcused delays by the Contractor, even though the actual damages may be an uncertain amount and unprovable.
The specific per diem rates of Liquidated Damages are ( /[enter amt if can reasonably determine-provide method of determination; otherwise] set forth below).  By executing the Contract, the Contractor acknowledges that such an amount is not a penalty and that the daily amount set forth in the Contract is a reasonable per diem forecast of damages incurred by the Owner due to the Contractor’s failure to complete the Work within the Contract Time.
Original Contract Amount Per Diem Amount From To of Liquidated Damages
